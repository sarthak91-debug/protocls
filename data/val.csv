why do i have backache?,"Well, there are any number of reasons you have a backache, and likewise, any number of remedies. The biggest reason is generally muscle strain. 

Since it's a strain, you can generally handle it much like any other strain (apply gentle warmth to the area to encourage blood flow and reduce activity that cause the problem). I've also found that taking    acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps me more than an asperin does, but that's just me. 

Obviously you should also consider avoiding whatever activity causes these backaches. Make sure you wear flat shoes with proper arch support, sit with your back flush against the back of the chair, lift with your legs, etc. 

If you're experiencing frequent backaches, or particularly severe ones, naturally, go see your doctor. Actually, seeing a doctor probably isn't that bad an idea since they'll be able to help identify causes and activities that may help reduce the problem. You could have strained your back lifting, in which rest and advil will fix you up in no time. Or it could just be from muscle fatigue from excercise - again, rest and advil. Or it could also be kidney failure, in which case the remedy would be more extreme. you have a back ache because it hurts back there, there are several methodes to relieve the pain... the boring way is to go to the chiropracter the more fun and interesting way is to expieriment with various narcotics or other mind altering chemicals
 hopeless addiction always seems to make bach aches seem insignifigant. There are many causes for backache.  You should know the cause first and then start your treatment to get rid of it.
Just saying backache does not help at all.
You should go into details and say more about it.  Where is the pain location? How long have you had it?  When does it get worse(Talk about factors making it worse)? Have you seen any MD or ben through any paraclinical test? And .......","Various factors can contribute to backaches, necessitating diverse remedies. It's crucial to identify and avoid activities triggering discomfort. Wearing supportive shoes, maintaining proper sitting posture, and lifting with the legs can alleviate strain. Persistent or severe backaches warrant a doctor's visit for a thorough assessment, as they can identify causes and recommend effective solutions. Muscle strain often emerges as a primary cause.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
My normally calm life is unraveling and I am stressed to the max.   Any stress busters?  No drugs or alcohol!?,"1) Stress & Tention Instant Breathing exercise.  Take a deep breath, then tense up your shoulders (tighen them and lift shoulders to ears;  really squeeze those shoulder muscles) count slowly to 5 (1 one-onethousand, two-onethousand. . .five-onethousand).  Slowly exhale.

Repete 10 times. . . this takes 5-7 min.  

2) Meditation & Yoga & Boxing are great when you can set up the time for these.  I find that when my life is unravalling, that I just can't make it to group exercise classes, so I have to do little exercises I've learned in the past classes for short intervals (say 5-10 minutes).

What is Citrus Naringin and how does it affect the human body?,"It is a natural chemical compound known as a bioflavanoid found in grapefruit, giving it its bitter flavor.
This powerful bioflavonoid has antioxidant and antifungal properties, and as such may help prevent cancer and atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), as well as a number of other ailments.

Naringin also works synergistically with other nutrients, increasing the bio-availability (how much nutrient is absorbed by the body) and therefore maximizing the health benefits of these nutrients.

"what are the symtoms of headache and stomachache,why it always happen to ladies and children most of the time?","The first answer seems to be correct. Headache:

A headache is a pain in the head with the pain being above the eyes or the ears, behind the head (occipital), or in the back of the upper neck. Headache, like chest pain or back ache, has many causes. 

All headaches are considered primary headaches or secondary headaches. Primary headaches are not associated with other diseases. Examples of primary headaches are migraine headaches, tension headaches, and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other diseases. The associated disease may be minor or major. 

Tension headaches are the most common type of primary headache. As many as 90% of adults have tension headaches. Tension headaches are more common among women than men. 

Migraine headaches are the second most common type of primary headache. An estimated 28 million people in the US have migraine headaches. Migraine headaches affect children as well as adults. Before puberty, boys and girls are affected equally by migraine headaches, but after puberty more women than men have them. Migraine often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as tension or sinus headaches. 

Cluster headaches are a rare but important type of primary headache, affecting mainly men. The average age of cluster headache sufferers is 28-30 years, although headaches may begin in childhood. 

Secondary headaches may result from innumerable conditions, ranging from life threatening ones such as brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhages to less serious but common conditions such as withdrawal from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics (pain killing medication). Many people suffer from ""mixed"" headache disorders in which tension headaches or secondary headaches may trigger migraine. 


Stomach ache:

Pain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (i.e., skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (i.e., beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called ""referred"" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area. 

Abdominal pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding. Abdominal pain may be minor and of no great significance, or it can reflect a major problem involving one of the organs in the abdomen. The characteristics of the pain--location, timing, duration, etc. are important in diagnosing its cause. Persisting abdominal pain should be evaluated by a physician.","Headaches, characterized by pain in the head, encompass primary types like tension, migraine, and cluster headaches, with tension headaches being the most prevalent. Migraines affect approximately 28 million people in the US, occurring in both children and adults, while cluster headaches are rare and predominantly affect men. Secondary headaches arise from various conditions, ranging from life-threatening issues to less severe problems. Stomach ache, or abdominal pain, can originate from organs within or close to the abdominal cavity, and its characteristics, including location and duration, are vital for diagnosis.

how do i grow muscles faster ?,"take green tea, and my trainor said to mix up ur work out one day lift maybe 5 pd barbell in one hand and 10 in the other, if u can lift more great!then the next day switch them, so ur body is always tearing and guessing never have a routine work out, do green tea because it helps ur immune system and replenishes ur body, but try useing different amounts of weight like everyother time good luck! do you know your body type, it can realy help you not to work against your self, try to search in wikipedia ''body type'' Workout 24 hours a day. working out anything past 45 min is a waste of time because you end up destroy your own current muscles for energy, and also leads to overtraining which will also waste your muscle and prevent them from recovering thus will not build you any new muscle. So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity.

also 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above.


now here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which you will gain them:

the secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways:

-changing the order of the exercise each work out
- changing the speed at which you lift the weights, slow or faster
-super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises
- giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part
- negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep
- stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight you can to muscle failure (when you can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeat

that's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so you must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly.

also there is the diet component:

proteins: make sure you eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that you arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat.

carbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portion

fats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oils

make sure you do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow.

make sure you sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep.

make sure you eat no more than 1 hour after your work outs

make sure you have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible 

throw junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. 

keep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body part

any more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck work them 3x 20 sets per day with weights rest every second day and drink a low fat milk and banana slurpee to help produce and heal worked muscle tissue use weights of 20 and 30 pounds................ creatin is the main matter of muscles.so buy a medicine which contents creatin in it.","Engage in a dynamic workout routine by incorporating a variety of exercises and techniques, such as changing lifting speeds, using super sets, giant sets, negatives, and stripping, to continually challenge and stimulate muscle growth. Limit workouts to around 45 minutes to prevent overtraining and muscle breakdown. Prioritize a balanced diet with recommended portion sizes for proteins, carbs, and healthy fats. Emphasize the importance of rest, quality sleep, and post-workout nutrition. Discourage the consumption of junk food and alcohol, and maintain a disciplined training schedule.

A nurse practitioner provides some care previously offered only by physicians and in most states has the ability to prescribe medications. Working in collaboration with a physician, a nurse practitioner provides high-quality, cost-effective and individualized care for the lifespan of patient's special needs. NPs focus largely on health maintenance, disease prevention, counseling and patient education in a wide variety of settings. With a strong emphasis on primary care, nurse practitioners are employed within several specialties, including neonatology, nurse-midwifery, pediatrics, school health, family and adult health, women's health, mental health, home care, geriatrics and acute care. 
Nurse practitioners are educated through programs that grant either a certificate or a master's degree. A registered nurse is recommended to have extensive clinical experience before applying to a nurse practitioner program. An intensive preceptorship under the direct supervision of a physician or an experienced nurse practitioner, as well as instruction in nursing theory, are key components to most NP programs. physician assistants (PAs) are non-physicians licensed to practice medicine with a physician's supervision. This supervision, in most cases, need not be direct or on site and many PAs practice in remote or underserved areas in satellite clinics. PAs can treat patients and, in most states, prescribe medicine, and in some states in the US they carry a DEA number that gives them authority to prescribe controlled medications like narcotics. PAs in surgical practices also serve as first assists in surgery. PAs provide medical services that are reimbursed under Medicare and third party insurances. Physician assistants and Nurse Practitioners both provide similar services in most states, the major distinction being that nurse practitioners are registered nurses by trade. Both are also known as Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) or mid-level practitioners (MLPs).","For information purposes, a nurse practitioner (NP) is a registered nurse with advanced academic and clinical expertise, capable of independently diagnosing and managing various common and chronic illnesses, often working as part of a healthcare team.

"if i am breastfeeding, what should i do to lose weight?","The wonderful thing about breastfeeding is that it burns an extra 300-500 calories a day! I was back down to 125lbs at 4 months after my baby was born and he was exclusively breastfed. You are able to do any exercise that is comfortable for your postpartum body. The only thing that is probably not okay are weight loss pills or supplements as they could pass through your milk to the baby; I would recommend checking them with a lactation consultant before using them. While breastfeeding, losing weight CAN be more difficult.  Most women find that they do not lose all of their ""baby"" weight until they wean (unless, like me, you had plenty of extra weight before the baby, and your body isn't all that concerned about if that pound is a ""baby"" pound or a ""too many chocolate donuts"" pound!).  However, weight loss during breastfeeding is possible (living proof!).  The best way to go is to reduce the number of calories you eat and increase your exercise (I know, it's not as fun as taking a diet pill, but it lasts longer!).  While breastfeeding, your body uses about 500 calories a day to make milk for baby.  The most important thing for you is to make sure the foods you are eating are 80-90 % healthy (like during pregnancy).  If you eat junk, your baby will still get good milk, but your body will suffer because you will not get the vitamens and minerals you need.  As far as exercise goes, if you haven't been exercising, start slowly.  And remember, it took 9 months to put the weight on -- it will likely take 9 months to take it off.","In users expereince, one individual went back to 125lbs at 4 months after their baby was born while he exclusively breastfeed.",experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"

How do I cure hiccups?,"You are gonna get a lot of answers saying to hold your breath, but that only works sometimes and not with every person. Try holding an ice cube to your throat for about 20 to 30 seconds. Also try holding your nose while you take big gulps of water.

The spoon full of sugar works too, but it's hard to swallow, you'll have to drink water anyway. Holding your breath doesn't really work. Burping does. There are two steps for a hiccup.. let's say you go hic (when you inhale) and then cup (when you exhale) Instead of exhaling the cup, burp it out. Hic, hold the air bubble in your throat and try to make it travel up, and burp it out. If you don't know how to make yourself burp (like myself), get yourself some coke or 7up or sprite, anything gassy to make you burp faster :o) eat one teaspoon of sugar, will provide instant relief! Eat a spoonful of sugar quickly. Your senses will overload with the response from the receptors that the sugar triggered off, and you won't hiccup anymore. focus on your middle name for 5-10 seconds then say it OUT LOUD. if that doesn't work, use brother/sisters middle name. 2 methods, both work, but one is a bit difficult
1. Bite down on the middle part of a straw or pen or pencil in your mouth (the straw is not in your mouth like you are using to drink with, you are biting on the middle so the ends are outside your mouth near your cheeks).  Then drink a half of a glass of water.

2.  Take a full glass of water and drink on the opposite side that you normally do (so your chin is pratically in the glass).  In order to do this you will have to bend your neck and head.  Drink about half the glass.

Well this is all the info I have!
Hope it helps! Eczema Treatment

While eczema cannot be cured, most cases can be controlled by:

Making lifestyle modifications to prevent flare-ups 

Seeing a dermatologist for treatment 

Using medication as prescribed 

This approach tends to prevent inflammation and itching and keeps eczema from getting worse. Dermatologists recommend that treatment be sought at the onset of signs and symptoms. When therapy begins early, it often reduces severity and duration. 

Diagnosis
Effective treatment requires a correct diagnosis; however, it is not always easy to distinguish one type of eczema from another or from similar skin conditions. Dermatologists have the medical training and experience needed to determine if eczema is present — and if present, which type. To diagnose eczema, dermatologists examine the skin and ask about: 

When the skin condition first appeared 

Signs and symptoms, such as long-term pruritus (itching) or recurring dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) 

Certain circumstances that may aggravate the condition, such as excessively dry air or emotional stress 

Family medical history, including questions about close blood relatives who have asthma, hay fever, or eczema 

Personal medical history 

In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other causes. 

Allergies are more common in individuals with atopic dermatitis, and allergy testing may be considered when a patient has:

Significant indications of allergies, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and colic in infants) or hives 

Been poorly responsive or unresponsive to treatment 

If a food allergy is suspected, testing for allergic reactions to eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, and tree nuts (e.g., walnuts, cashews) are usually performed as these foods are responsible for 85% of all food allergies. A positive allergy test does not confirm the food allergy. A suspected food allergy must be subjected to a ""challenge."" A challenge is conducted by having the patient eat the suspected food and observing the patient for a reaction. Even a challenge does not guarantee that the food is the trigger because: 1) another trigger may be present and causing the reaction or 2) the patient’s reaction may be delayed. Consequently, allergy testing has limited value. However, it is useful for eliminating foods that cause immediate and severe reactions or welts.

Dermatologists may use a “patch test” to determine if the patient has allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema that develops when the person has an allergic reaction to a substance that contacts the skin. The reaction generally occurs a few hours after the substance contacts the skin and settles down within a few days if the substance does not contact the skin again. A patch test exposes the patient’s skin to minute amounts of substances that may have caused the reaction. When the test is positive, the dermatologist must determine if the chemical caused the dermatitis and if so, if it is the primary cause or an aggravating factor. Further testing may be necessary.

Treatment
Once eczema is diagnosed, a treatment plan will be made based on:

Type and severity of the eczema present 

Age, health, and medical history (including presence of other conditions) 

History of previous treatment 

The primary goal of treatment is to relieve discomfort by controlling the signs and symptoms. Since eczema is usually dry and itchy, most treatment plans involve applying lotions, creams, or ointments to keep the skin as moist as possible. The treatment plan also may require lifestyle modifications and using medication as directed. 

A topical (applied to the skin) medication may be prescribed to help relieve itching and inflammation. Another way to treat the itch is with a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching is severe, a sedative antihistamine may be recommended. Skin infections caused by bacteria, such as staphylococ You have to detoxify your body from toxins. All diseases are results of your lifestyle. Once you get detox your eczema will dissapear. Go to the doctor. Get a prescription, or keep your skin well oiled,(moistened) to keep it from constant break out. you should never at any circumstances let your skin get dry.

"I have a soar throat and mouth ulcer now, it is there for a week now. Any natural way or home ideas?","I recently answered a similar question but only dealing with sore throat.  The best natural method I am familiar with is licorice.  A double clinical study of patients with nonspecific sore throat tested licorice tea (throat coat brand) and found a significant reduction in throat pain as compared with placebo in as little as 10 minutes.  Patients were told to consume this tea 4-6 times per day.

Licorice tea will probably also help with the pain of the mouth sore, even if it does not make the sore heal faster, but it might help with that too.

Licorice has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help with the blister.

One warning, though,  is that you should not consume too much licorice, especially if you have blood pressure problems.  A case report from the Netherlands reported that excessive consumption of licorice tea (about 3 liters per day, so a lot) can temproarily raise blood pressure.

after having showers with hot water or getting hot(due to blankets) during sleeping i get an allergy?,"I suffer from the same thing.

It's hives.  

It can be an allergic reaction - if you're having other symptoms of allergies like watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, then it could just be an extension of whatever you're allergic to.

But hives can be brought on by heat without an allergic reaction.  Nobody knows for sure why it happens in the absence of other allergies.  But heat brings blood to the surface of the skin and allows hives to develop.

If you scratch them, they will spread.  Sometimes mine itch when they're just flat red wheals, and sometimes they don't... but if I so much as touch a wheal before it swells, POOF! Not only does it swell and itch a lot worse, but it tells all its friends and neighbors, and it spreads like wildfire.

I have had chronic hives for 6 months now - due to allergies.  I take a Claritin and a Singulair every day, and it still doesn't completely get rid of them.  I am undergoing allergy shots.

One other thing you can do is to get some Ivarest. You can find it at Walgreens. I've tried everything else on the market, and only Ivarest keeps the hives down for longer than an hour or so.  It's a little more expensive, but a tube will last me several weeks, instead of just a day or two like a tube of Benadryl cream.

You can also take Benadryl before a shower to help keep the hives down to a minimum.

If you don't get relief of them within about six weeks, go to the doctor and get tested for allergies. I had the same problem when I was child so my doctor told me I should having shower with warm water 3 times a week and after shower you have to put some cream to your body and never sleep with hot blankets so try some soft sheets and also never wear kind of things that make your body hot ALWAYS wear 100% cotton.

"Are there side effects of long time consumption of tranquilizer Xanax (.5 mg/day,  2 yrs now) ?","Well, that depends... Why are you on the drug in the first place? Yes. There are side effects involved with the long-term ingestion of any benzodiazepine type anti-anxiolytic. For the most part, they are withdrawal effects. Higher doses taken for longer periods of time will produce more discomfort when trying to stop the drug. This MUST be done with the help of a physician, and MUST be tapered slowly over a period of time depending on the half-life of the drug. However, if Xanax is helping you, and keeping an anxiety disorder ""under control"" -- you should carefully weigh the costs vs. benefits of stopping a helpful medication.

There are some very good nutritional strategies that can help with anxiety. You may want to check out your local health food store and get some suggestions. Alternative Medicine and Natural Healing information is also available. But please don't do anything without first consulting your physician! (Ask your pharmacist as well, they are a great source of untapped medical knowledge!) Good Luck! Physical or psychological dependance.

why do only women get periods and men don't?,"Well, the reason blood goes to that part of a woman's body is to support the possible baby that might form. When the body realizes no baby is gonna be formed, it lets the blood go.

When the body recognizes that no pregnancy is occurring, it releases the accumulated blood, resulting in menstruation. Menstruation is a unique biological process in females connected to the reproductive system. Since men do not give birth or experience pregnancy, they do not undergo menstruation. The distinct reproductive functions in men and women are tied to their respective physiological roles in the continuation of the species, and this divergence is evident in the development of different reproductive organs.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"

If you are truly concerned, consider getting a second opinion from a doctor of your own choosing, NOT one that's been recommended by the doc that gave you the first reading.

Sometimes a lump is just a lump.  Breasts get lumpy during certain times of the month, and goes along with normal cycles.  Calcifications and shadowing are pretty routine findings as well.  If there was something to be concerned about, the first doc would have ordered a biopsy on the lump.  A biopsy is where a needle is inserted into the lump and a sample is taken to be studied, to determine whether it is cancerous. This same time last year I was experiencing the same thing.  No one was ever really sure what the lump was but it wasn't cancerous.  I even had a biopsy after the ultrasound and mammogram showed nothing.  Perhaps your doctor will schedule one for you.  And if nothing still shows up they will schedule you for another ultrasound in six months.
I've had my six month check up, and I'm happy to say IT'S STILL NOTHING!!
I wish you the best.

Why are there so many terrible psychiatrists?,"I could answer this several different ways. Peter Breggin is the author of ""Talking back to Prozac"" and ""Toxic Psychiatry"". David Healy is anti-drug but pro-ECT (electroconvulsive therapy which 'treats' bipolar and depression).  Dr. John Burrows has his own podcast, in which he says that benzos are ""evil"" or very close to it. 

So clearly, there are some 'good' psychiatrists not necessarily corrupted by the pharmecuetical company. My brief scan of the research on Google Scholar, searching for ""psychiatric ward culture"" indicates that psychiatrists rely on an authoritation methedology -- do what I say without asking why. 

I also think that little is known about the antipsychotics. My father, a biochemist, calls them ""blunt instruments"" and they are. I counsel people to stick to the least-invasive remedy. (ie. mood stabilizers for bipolar rather than antipsychotics (also called neuroleptics.) Peter Breggin has an entire essay at http://www.breggin.com on why their use should be limited.

I would get a second opinion from ancupunturists, cranial-sacral massage therapists (mine helped me a lot, although was not around like my psychiatrist was), and even a good alternative pharmacy if you have one in your area. I had a manic episode, and found a Total Omega-3 supplement (fish-based) to really improve at least my own sense of health. There is scientific evidence emerging that Omega-3 helps with depression and possibly bipolar.

I could rant on and on on this topic. But if you go to my portal at http://health.wikispaces.com and register you will get access to all my thoughts as they evolve. (Think of it as a blog where I am encouraging other people to research and contribute.) I think you and your shrink are victims of the American Pharmaceutical Industry.  The biggest drug dealers in history.  So powerful most doctors are under pressure to over-prescribe.  Doctors also have to deal with confused patients who read about new drugs in magazines see new drugs on television and  are being market new drugs in commercials and advertising.

 At the other end of the spectrum you have the real lack of psychiatric care under the American Health Insurance Industry.

So there you have it: we are left with bills and pills to solve everything. Forget the pod bay doors, man, you opened the floodgates! Hit-the-nail-on-the-head and won the 64 thousand dollar question all at the same time!!! Something is PROFOUNDLY WRONG with many, many, many of these ""physicians."" Re-read your question and you have your answer... I have had similar experiences. Sigmund Freud took them into the ""dark abyss"" of ""Analysis"" and today they have cleaned themselves up, put on nice clothes, will ""cheerfully"" give you 10 to 15 minutes of their ""holier than thou"" time, charge you a fortune for Evaluation and Management (E & M) and dispense inummerable combinations and complexities of ""pharmacologic agents."" Experience? Yes.

From great suffering comes great compassion --
I have battled clinical depression for over 30 years now -- and have much experience with these ""men (and women) of medicine."" If there were as many good dentists as there are psychiatrists, no one in America would have any teeth...

Shrink? Angry with me? Fix Your Field Of Medicine! Fix ""YOURSELF!""

water??really??,"not only does it keep you hydrated, but it also keeps your body functions regular, and helps your kidneys. your body is 70% water, you know?!? you need to keep that level up! it also keeps your skin moisturized when out in the sun and what not. gives you a healthy glow! drink plenty!! The human body needs water to maintain enough blood and other fluids to function properly.  Along with the fluids, the body also needs electrolytes, which are salts normally found in blood, other fluids, and cells. 

The body may lose fluids in a variety of ways:

when urinating 
when you vomit or have diarrhea 
when sweating 
from the lungs during normal breathing.

If the body loses a substantial amount of fluids and salts and they are not quickly replaced, for example, by drinking, the body starts to ""dry up"" or get dehydrated.

Severe dehydration can cause death.

When you feel thirsty, you have already begun to dehydrate, so it's best to drink water as often as possible, even when you're not thirsty. Without it we would die. There would be no life. u should drink water so u can live to see the next day it gives u moistur and celebraties eat only meat and water. it cleans out your internal systems it keeps you from de-hydryting Well someone in my family who I wont mentioned had lots of zits adn greasy face, but once they started drinking lots of water that person's face got really nice and clear and really pretty !

how do u get rid of lice?,"Go to your local pharmacy or drugstore.  You can purchase a product called ""RID"". Its a shampoo that kills headlice.  Once you've shampooed, you'll take the small comb, that comes with the shampoo to comb the hair to remove dead lice or possible eggs that may be attatched.  Very important to stip bed of sheets and pillow cases and wash in hot water as soon as possible, too.   Good luck!  (Rid is sold over the counter, btw..so don't be embarrassed.) Rid can sometimes cause damage to the blood and brain cells on the head if there are scratches or open cuts when applied.  Also, not all lice is killed by using Rid.  Try putting either vaseline or olive oil in the hair and on the head.  Wrap with saran wrap for about an hour.  Rinse out.  It kills the lice and the eggs by suffocation. soak ure hair in mayo, like shampoo, and cover it in tin foil GO TO WAL MART I THINK THE THING IS CALLED RID Don't use the stuff you buy in stores, that is a pesticide and it doesn't really work.  This is how I've dealt with headlice.  

The first thing you have to do is apply a thick coating of either Vaseline or mineral oil to the hair.  Get a plastic shower cap and put it on. Leave the stuff in the hair over the weekend.  When you wash is out, you have to make sure you get all the nits (eggs).  Do this for 3 weekends in a row, and the little critters will all be dead and gone.

It's also a good idea to vacumn all the carpets and wash the linens and any stuffed toys.  Lice only live for a short time if they aren't on a person, but there is no point taking a chance if you are going to walk around with your head all gooped up for the weekend. Sorry, but I agree w/ kytrailman.  OTC remedies DO work and they're a lot safer than some of the other posters have said.  Poor kid.  Don't subject him to DIY remedies--get it over with as quickly as you can.

I did want to add one thing.  Make sure you read the directions in the box.  You'll probably have to re-apply the product at least once to kill the ""hatchlings"".  That's REALLY important.","The recommended approach for treating head lice is to use a specialized product like ""RID"" shampoo, following the instructions provided. Combing the hair with the accompanying comb helps remove dead lice and eggs. Additionally, washing bedding and linens in hot water is crucial to prevent reinfestation. Some alternative methods, such as using Vaseline, olive oil, or mayo, may be suggested, but it's essential to follow proven methods and products for effective and timely treatment.

The use of natural progesterone cream, not the synthetic form of the hormone, which is available only by prescription, but a plant derivative of a type of yam widely available in health food stores. 


Drugs may be used to relieve symptoms or to shrink fibroids, but only temporarily. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alone or given with a progestin (a drug similar to the hormone progesterone), can reduce bleeding caused by fibroids.  Hormonal contraceptives can control bleeding in some women. However, when women discontinue contraceptives, abnormal bleeding and pain tend to recur. Also, when some women are treated with contraceptives, the fibroids grow. cut out caffeine.  It wokrked for me. I have heard that shark cartilage which you can buy over the counter works well.

Natural progesterone cream, derived from plant sources like yams and available in health food stores, may help manage symptoms and potentially reduce fibroid size as an alternative to synthetic progesterone.

how can you releive sciatic pain?,"Manual treatments for sciatica, including physical therapy and specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and manual manipulation (e.g. osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation) to help relieve the pressure on the nerve root, which is the cause of the pain. Medical treatments for sciatica, including medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to help relieve the inflammation, which is usually a component of the pain. Surgery for sciatica, such as microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root. This surgery is designed to help relieve both the pressure and inflammation and may be warranted if the sciatic nerve pain is severe and has not been relieved with appropriate manual or medical treatments. Surgery and meds are the last option IMO! 

The first thing to do is determine the cause and to see if it is true sciatica. Try seeing a Chiropractor. They are excellent at analyzing xrays and will be able to determine why the sciatica is happening and will either refer out or provide treatment.

What  are the symptoms Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?,"Mental retardation is the most common and serious birth defect associated with FAS.  Perhaps the most notable defects in FAS involve the face and eyes. In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss. More than 90 percent of infants with FAS have delays in receptive and expressive language development. Please see the links listed below.  Also consult your doctor and talk to your doctor more if you are suspicious.

    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.

    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.

    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.

|Medical Treatment|

Many treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.

    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.

          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.

          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.

    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.

          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.

                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.

                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a ""bad sunburn"" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.

          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).

                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.

                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK I had acne for about 12 years, and it wouldn't go away inspite of the soaps, creams, lotions and antibiotics that I had used.  I got rid of acne after doing a treatment for candida.  I took herbal antifungals, lactobacillus acidophilus, and I was following an anti-candida diet. Acne takes years to get rid of. Many people right away use OTC medicine to cure it. Destorying the live bacteria on the face is a critical action. You should get rid of acne at the first sign. Chasing pimples all over your face becomes hectic but its the only way. Some people are allergic to bacteria killing medicine such as benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin. 
Try using these medicines:
1) Differin Topical Gel
2) Clearsal Brand Fighter.
3) Oxy
4) Proactiv (RISK: Increased Acne)
Rx:
1) Adoxa (Doxycyline Tablets)
2) Duac Topical Gel

Remember, allowing more oils and creams/lotions to your face means more blockage and heat to be stored. This causes the over size pimple. Make sure you have some sort of invigorating rubbing cream. St.Ives apricot scrub is the best.
If else fails, seek your Physician. An expert germ physician. At young acne years, doctors might perscribe you with bacteria killing pills. This is excellent.

What is Rieke?,"It is spelled Reiki and pertains to the use of energy to heal the body.

""Reiki is a form of Japanese spiritual healing.  This complementary medicine has its foundation in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, apparently forgotten until its rediscovery in the late 19th century.  The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on ""reiki energy"" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  

A treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or ""chakras.""  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.""

is ther a way of removing gall stones without surgery?,"There is often some confusion on the difference between gallstones and kidney stones.  Kidney stones form in urine in the kidneys (redundant, I know, but hang in there).  They are most commonly calcium oxalate (but calcium doesn't cause the stones!).  In order for them to be passed without surgery, they have to go through the ureters to the urine bladder, and then through the urethra to exit the body.

Gallstones are formed in the gall bladder which stores bile created by the liver.  They are most commonly formed of cholesterol.  The gall bladder pumps bile into the top of the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and fat soluble vitamins.  And here's the big difference.  If a gallstone actually makes it out of the gallbladder, it will enter the small intestines and leave the body in feces.  

The bile duct, btw, is normally about 4mm but may go up to 7mm if there are lodged stones.  

Now consider what someone who is claiming that their solution will allow gallstones to pass the body (with pictures!) is supposedly doing to find these gallstones.

(And because I can't resist a good line)  If you pee it out, it's a kidney stone, if you poop it out it's a gallstone.


Now, having said all of that, I see that the Mayo clinic does have a sound wave treatment for gallstones, but they indicate that it is appropriate for only a small number of cases.  And that the gallstones will come back on you unless you take a special medicine for the rest of your life.

You can try to control your gallstones by eating a very low fat, cholesterol controlling diet.  This might keep the stones from getting larger.  However, you will need to keep an eye on them, as they can get large enough to cause more serious problems than pain. I am givig you a link for a site that will answer you question and many more medical questions you may have. I have personaly done the liver/gall bladder flush with positive results and most people caan avoid surgery using this method. If you have trouble finding it let me know and i'll get the whole outline for you. ultrasound, which is non-invasive, depends on size of stones dont think so- go ahead and have the surgery, its worth it and you will never have that pain again- the longer you wait, the less chance of minimally invasive success.  Be sure to ask for minimally invasive surgery if possible- 90% recovery in about 1 week, walking the next day. NO!","For information purposes, gallstones form in the gallbladder and are mostly made of cholesterol. They exit the body through the intestines in feces if they manage to leave the gallbladder.

Well this is all the info I have!
Hope it helps! Eczema Treatment

While eczema cannot be cured, most cases can be controlled by:

Making lifestyle modifications to prevent flare-ups 

Seeing a dermatologist for treatment 

Using medication as prescribed 

This approach tends to prevent inflammation and itching and keeps eczema from getting worse. Dermatologists recommend that treatment be sought at the onset of signs and symptoms. When therapy begins early, it often reduces severity and duration. 

Diagnosis
Effective treatment requires a correct diagnosis; however, it is not always easy to distinguish one type of eczema from another or from similar skin conditions. Dermatologists have the medical training and experience needed to determine if eczema is present — and if present, which type. To diagnose eczema, dermatologists examine the skin and ask about: 

When the skin condition first appeared 

Signs and symptoms, such as long-term pruritus (itching) or recurring dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) 

Certain circumstances that may aggravate the condition, such as excessively dry air or emotional stress 

Family medical history, including questions about close blood relatives who have asthma, hay fever, or eczema 

Personal medical history 

In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other causes. 

Allergies are more common in individuals with atopic dermatitis, and allergy testing may be considered when a patient has:

Significant indications of allergies, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and colic in infants) or hives 

Been poorly responsive or unresponsive to treatment 

If a food allergy is suspected, testing for allergic reactions to eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, and tree nuts (e.g., walnuts, cashews) are usually performed as these foods are responsible for 85% of all food allergies. A positive allergy test does not confirm the food allergy. A suspected food allergy must be subjected to a ""challenge."" A challenge is conducted by having the patient eat the suspected food and observing the patient for a reaction. Even a challenge does not guarantee that the food is the trigger because: 1) another trigger may be present and causing the reaction or 2) the patient’s reaction may be delayed. Consequently, allergy testing has limited value. However, it is useful for eliminating foods that cause immediate and severe reactions or welts.

Dermatologists may use a “patch test” to determine if the patient has allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema that develops when the person has an allergic reaction to a substance that contacts the skin. The reaction generally occurs a few hours after the substance contacts the skin and settles down within a few days if the substance does not contact the skin again. A patch test exposes the patient’s skin to minute amounts of substances that may have caused the reaction. When the test is positive, the dermatologist must determine if the chemical caused the dermatitis and if so, if it is the primary cause or an aggravating factor. Further testing may be necessary.

Treatment
Once eczema is diagnosed, a treatment plan will be made based on:

Type and severity of the eczema present 

Age, health, and medical history (including presence of other conditions) 

History of previous treatment 

The primary goal of treatment is to relieve discomfort by controlling the signs and symptoms. Since eczema is usually dry and itchy, most treatment plans involve applying lotions, creams, or ointments to keep the skin as moist as possible. The treatment plan also may require lifestyle modifications and using medication as directed. 

A topical (applied to the skin) medication may be prescribed to help relieve itching and inflammation. Another way to treat the itch is with a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching is severe, a sedative antihistamine may be recommended. Skin infections caused by bacteria, such as staphylococ You have to detoxify your body from toxins. All diseases are results of your lifestyle. Once you get detox your eczema will dissapear. Go to the doctor. Get a prescription, or keep your skin well oiled,(moistened) to keep it from constant break out. you should never at any circumstances let your skin get dry. Try the over the counter Cortizone, or A&D ointment.",In one of the cases eczema was controlled with prescription drugs during winter as they didn't experience the symptoms during the summer due to the skin being wet and moisturized.

On your exhale, feel for the weight of your head and gravity creating more distance between your left ear and your left shoulder. Continue to breathe in this way.

If your in Indiana. You might try getting on Indiana Medicaid. Contact the insulin manufacturer directly. My wife's aunt lost her insurance and got free insulin from them. There are various resources that you can probably consult to get assistance in paying for your diabetic supplies / insulin. A good starting point would be your local department of health location or local social services office. Both locations should be able to refer you to the appropriate program or service to meet your needs. Your local health department (depending on where you live) may also have what is known as a ""pharmacy access"" or ""pharmacy assistance"" program. These programs are in place to assist individuals of limited means access the necessary medications and pharmaceutical supplies to treat their medical conditions. 
There are probably several other resources you might consider contacting. Many Red Cross chapters offer such assistance, as well as private medical practices and even church groups. Don't be afraid to ask your primary care doctor or diabetic specialist for assistance in securing resources for this problem. Also, consider doing an internet search and check out some of the major pharmaceutical companies (Bayer, Abbott, etc.) Maybe they offer assistance as well. I am sure help is out there for you. 
Best of luck in your search... Generic insulin is fairly cheap, so if you really can't afford it, you are probably eligible for medicaid in your state.  However, Eli Lilly and Sanofi-Aventis are two drug companies that make insulin.  They probably have assistance programs, and if your income is below a certain level (usually 2x poverty) you would qualify for free drug.  Ask your doctor for the forms.

Is my baby too big?,"It depends on your family history. My older sister has 3 boys, they all were ""normal"" size when born and her 2yrs old is the size of a 4yrs. old. People mistake them for being older all the time. As long as they are not FAT, obese, have celulite, I would not worry. My cousins 7 yrs old is as tall as my 10 yrs. old and just thick. All the hormones and stuff they put in our food and milk, doesn't help with these issues. Good Luck kids vary in size....what one person thinks is too big, another might think is too small...my daughter is 6 years old and weighs 34 lbs....I was worried she wasn't eating enough or something, the doctor said it's a normal weight. if you think your son is too big, try to do something about it. if you don't, don't worry. My cousins son was a big baby, if I recall he may have been around the same weight as your son at the same age. now he's six and weighs about 50 lbs. so it'll all even out. don't worry.

Another expresses concern about their daughter's weight but is reassured by the doctor that it's normal.

how do you get rid of the common cold?,"The common cold is primarily different varieties of viruses.  Viruses enter your body when your immune system has been weakened.  This could be due to a number of factors.  The most common is lack of rest.  If you do not receive the proper amount of sleep every night, your immune system is weakened.  

The best way (I have found) get rid of a cold is to get LOTS of rest, drink lots of oj (nonconcentrated), and drinking PLENTY of water.  Water helps to flush out all impurities in your body.  This has always helped me to recover quickly.

Another way to boost your immune system is to a daily mulit-vitman.  Make sure that it has B-12 in it as well.  B-12 is execellent for boosting and maintaining a healthy immune system. Zicam.  It really works.  
It is a zinc compound.
I'm on my first cold of the season, I'm counting on Zicam to shorten it.
I've avoided them so far using this.
I think that the only reason this one got me is because I started on Zicam late as this cold manifested overnight. flush it out
drink as much water and juices with vitamic c as possible. A few years ago, a new natural product hit the market. It's called AIRBORNE and was developed by a second-grade teacher. It is amazing. It is best to take it when you first notice symptoms.  I have used it several times with excellent results. I have also given it to my family members and they too have had their ""cold time"" greatly reduced.

I also take 1000 mg C in the morning and another dose 12 hours later.

http://www.airbornehealth.com/main.html I go nuts with EmergenC (whatever your body doesn't need, it will flush out).  Also, since there's little else that can be done, I just pamper myself with yummy, tasty food, baths, movie rentals, etc...  If you absolutely have to stay home from work, treat it like a mini-vacation.  I seriously believe that eliminating stress and raising your happiness levels makes the cold go away faster. Let it be__It is only the miracle of the body eliminating excess. The worst you can do is to treat the symptom with medication as they will only stop the cleansing process leaving not only the excess but also the residual drug residue. Not a good thing to have your body deal with over the years. The best thing to do is nothing while allowing your body to use its Primary Intelligence  and heal itself Stay warm and away from the ill contacts. 
Take some decongestant and soothers.
Drink some hot soup.
watch TV.
Enjoy The common cold is caused by viruses. There's very little we can do against that. You just have to wait for the battle between your immune system and the virus to finish. Anything you can do to help your immune system would help though, like be careful not to get a second infection or catch anything bacterial, etc. Plenty of fluids and plenty of rest.

There are many causes of hypertension, including an adrenalin secreting tumor, narrowing of the renal (kidney) arteries, etc. Most commonly, there is no clear cause.

Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes develops when your body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin or when your pancreas produces some, but not enough, insulin to maintain a normal glucose level.

There are side effects involved with the long-term ingestion of any benzodiazepine type anti-anxiolytic. For the most part, they are withdrawal effects.

This MUST be done with the help of a physician, and MUST be tapered slowly over a period of time depending on the half-life of the drug.

"How do you treat carpal tunnel, or how does a doctor?","Your carpal bones make a u shape.  The top of this u is covered by a thick membrane called the flexor retinaculum.  This u with a covering forms a tunnel called the carpal tunnel.  A number of muscle tendons and an important nerve called the median nerve pass through this tunnel.  Compression of the median nerve results in carpal tunnel syndrome.  The fastest way to fix this is by surgery in which the surgeon cuts the flexor retinaculum, loosening the covering of the carpal tunnel. Ewww no. Listen not about any surgeries. It's not necessary. Sublingual B12 works very good for carpal tunnel. Overdose on B12 for at least 3-5 days or until the pain goes away. Take about 2500 mcg split into at least 2 different dosages in a day.

What is strabismus?
If your baby's eyes seem to point in different directions or not focus on the same object, he may have strabismus — a lack of coordination between the eyes. They may appear to be ""crossed"" or one may seem to drift inward, outward, or upward. Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then).

What is amblyopia?
Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye. This can happen if your baby's eyes are misaligned or if he can't see as well with one eye because of nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or something that's blocking clear vision in that eye, like a cataract or a drooping eyelid.

About 3 to 6 percent of children under the age of 6 develop amblyopia. Treatment is most successful before age 5 or 6, although recent research shows that even older children may recover their vision. If ignored, though, amblyopia can result in permanent vision loss. This sounds like a vestibular problem to me.  The nerves in your ears that help you with balance also have connections to the muscles that move your eyes.  I would definitely make an appointment with an optometrist or ophthalmologist so you can get this taken care of as early as possible.","For information purposes, strabismus is a condition where a lack of coordination between the eyes causes them to point in different directions, leading to crossed or misaligned eyes.

Around 3 to 6 percent of children under 6 may develop amblyopia, and timely treatment is crucial to prevent permanent vision loss.

I have no insurance and need help paying for my insulin. Are there any programs that can help me?,"It all depends on where you live.
You should have added which state you live in?
If your in Indiana. You might try getting on Indiana Medicaid. Contact the insulin manufacturer directly. My wife's aunt lost her insurance and got free insulin from them. There are various resources that you can probably consult to get assistance in paying for your diabetic supplies / insulin. A good starting point would be your local department of health location or local social services office. Both locations should be able to refer you to the appropriate program or service to meet your needs. Your local health department (depending on where you live) may also have what is known as a ""pharmacy access"" or ""pharmacy assistance"" program. These programs are in place to assist individuals of limited means access the necessary medications and pharmaceutical supplies to treat their medical conditions. 
There are probably several other resources you might consider contacting. Many Red Cross chapters offer such assistance, as well as private medical practices and even church groups. Don't be afraid to ask your primary care doctor or diabetic specialist for assistance in securing resources for this problem. Also, consider doing an internet search and check out some of the major pharmaceutical companies (Bayer, Abbott, etc.) Maybe they offer assistance as well. I am sure help is out there for you. 
Best of luck in your search... Generic insulin is fairly cheap, so if you really can't afford it, you are probably eligible for medicaid in your state.  However, Eli Lilly and Sanofi-Aventis are two drug companies that make insulin.  They probably have assistance programs, and if your income is below a certain level (usually 2x poverty) you would qualify for free drug.  Ask your doctor for the forms.

Do you feel that face transplants are morally acceptable? Especially in cases of severe disfigurement?,"What kind of question is this? A face transplant is no different than an organ transplant in that it is an operation that drastically increases the quality of life for the recipient.

I add to this that there has only ever been one face transplant done in the history of medicine. A woman received a donor face because her own face was eaten by her dog. This all happened earlier this month.

This happened with the blessing of the donor's family and thanks to these brave doctors the woman can now go out in public and eat (she couldn't keep food in her mouth when she had no cheeks).

How on earth could this be considered morally unacceptable?

As for Manar's ascertation that criminals will get face transplants to avoid prosecution (I think that's what he was getting at, it's hard to tell when the grammar is so bad), this is absolutely ridiculous. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars for one of these operations, not to mention that it's not like the movie ""Face Off."" It requires months of recovery coupled with the attention of the world-wide press.

Honestly, some of these questions are ridiculous. In my opinion I wouldn't want someone else's face on mine. Life is life we have to learn to accept what happens in it. Those that love us will still love us no matter what happens to our face.

Would you categorize Bulimia Nervosa with Heroin addiction?  Why?,"I'm with Scorpio on this one.  Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).

What matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.

Addicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.

Today, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.

Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?,"It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):

An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. 

There are two main types of ulcers- 

Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. 

Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. 

How do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. 

Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. 

There may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. 

There are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium ""H. pylori"" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. 

Some medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. 

Tense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. ""The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide"" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. 

Although uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. 



When a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. 

If you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. 

The above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.  Our information is not medical advice.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is not very sweet in itself, that may be why Equal puts Dextrose (sugar) and maltodextrin as the first ingredients, so that it tastes sweet.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is a brain drug that stimulates your brain so you think that the food you're eating tastes sweet. If you pay attention you'll notice that when using Aspartame/Nutrasweet, everything you eat at the same time also tastes sweet! This may be why Aspartame/Nutrasweet causes you to crave carbohydrates. Hence, you won't lose weight using it.
BTW, cyclamates got pulled off the market in the 70's in the US (but not Canada or the rest of the world) because the sugar industry saw too much of their market disappear.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet (aspartylphenylalanine-methyl-ester) breaks down to its poison constituents at 86 degrees (Aspartic Acid 40%, Phenylalanine 50%, and Methanol 10%). Remember your stomach is at 98.6 degrees! Therefore you should never use Aspartame/Nutrasweet in hot beverages or cooked foods such as Jello. How the FDA allows this remains a mystery. There is mounting evidence that the ""Burning Mouth Syndrome"" experienced by the Desert Storm troops was actually Methanol poisoning from the Diet Coke they drank lots of, after being exposed to desert temperatures.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 10% Methanol appears in the body quickly and is the same alcohol (wood alcohol also in lacquer thinner), that your mother correctly warned you could make you blind. Many skid-row alcoholics had major problems with this cheap but deadly form of alcohol.
# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 40% Aspartic Acid is an ""excitotoxin"" in the brain and excites neurons to death, i.e. it kills brain cells and causes other nerve damage.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet triggers Migraine Headaches This even happened to me!. The Usenet is filled with posts by people who have pinned their migraines down to aspartame/Nutrasweet consumption.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's breakdown products attack the bodies tissues and create Formaldehyde which builds up in the tissues forever. Remember the smelly, eye watering fumes from the frogs you dissected in school? They were preserved with Formaldehyde! Formaldehyde is thought to cause cancer.
The American Bottlers Association did not want the FDA to approve Aspartame/Nutrasweet because of what the test report showed. But the FDA approved it anyway!

# Airline pilots stay away from Aspartame/Nutrasweet because they are well aware of the documented dangers.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet also breaks down to diketopiperazine [DKP] which is proven to cause Brain Tumors! Brain Tumors used to be rare. Several of the rats in the original study formed brain tumors during their Aspartame/Nutrasweet exposure. The researchers surgically removed the tumors and returned the rats to the study and discounted the tumors sure if you drink like a 12 pack a dayfor yur whole life.","Although not correlated scientifically, A person shared that their relative had to quit soda as it caused or exacerbated their ulcers.",experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"

What causes elevated ammonia levels in your system?,"Ammonia results from the breakdown of protein in the body. Most ammonia in the body forms when protein is broken down by bacteria in the intestinal tract. The liver normally converts ammonia into urea, which is then eliminated in urine.

Ammonia levels rise in the blood when the liver is unable to convert ammonia to urea. This may occur because of cirrhosis or severe hepatitis. When excess amounts of ammonia build up in the blood, symptoms of abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), such as unclear thinking, extreme sleepiness, a characteristic hand tremor (asterixis), or coma may develop.

It is considered scoliosis when the amount of curvature of the spine is > 10 degrees. It usually is due to congenital malformations or muscular disease. We categorize it by age of onset. The pattern is named for the locations (e.g. cervical, thoracic, or lumbar) and the side of the convexity (levo is where the convexity is to left and dextro is to the right). The time of most rapid curvature is just before and during puberty. There is usually little progression of scoliosis after puberty, unless the patient has muscle disease and the disease progresses.

Can I spread the herpes virus to my children?,"In some situations yes you can The answer is yes! 

Herpes simplex viruses may be passed from person to person by contact with an infected individual's sores, either on the mouth or on the genitals. Herpes simplex infections may also be passed through saliva or genital fluids of someone who is infected with herpes but has no active symptoms at the time of contact.

See source link for more on herpes. You need to be especially careful, and you need to stop kissing your kids for a while. If you want to, you can wipe off surfaces, but usually the virus isn't transfered by touch unless your kids like to suck their fingers. Just be careful. ok here is the deal herpes has 2 types simplex a and simplex b i dont remember which is which but as i understand it they are both pretty much the same with the exception that one is oral the other is genetal 

ok now this may get a little descriptive if so then please forgive me 

if you have the oral kind   i believe simplex a  which is esentially what coldsores are then you prolly have already given it to your kids if you have ever kissed them 

if it is simplex b  the genetal kind you more or less need to engage in what i will refer to as a high transmission risk activity, i'm going to assume you know what i mean by that, with your kids for them to be high risk of getting it 

also of note if you have simplex a you can give simplex b to somone else by giving them oral pleasure the same is also true if they have b then you can get a. 

now i'm going to assume you have b and you are worried about giving your children b since you seem concerned about your kids i'm going to assume you are not engaging in high risk activities. which leaves other things like faucets and toilet seats

TOILET SEATS  can be a form of transmission   however it is VERY unlikely EXTREEMLY FEW reported cases  as most std's do not survive long in an oxygen environment.  it is even less likely for boys as they tend to sit less than girls. girls also have easier access on a toilet seat to a likely point of infection  (eg the mucus producing membranes on pretty much the entire vaganal wall) howerev again there is not a high risk you would really need to leave some residue or secretion on the toilet seat that would be sat upon within a reletively short period of time in a manner that is not likely to be sat upon 

so rule 1 lysol and or bleach wipe the toilet seat when youre finished all the time not just during outbreak as herpes can be passed even when you are not simptomatic

the faucet even less likely of b to b xmition possable b to a xmition  

from genetal area to hand then reducing amount hand to faucet (increased exposure to o2 environment) then enters ""sally or billy"" turns on faucet then touches mouth or gets glass of water wich touches mouth...    very unlikely that sally or billy will turn on faucet then be touching genetal region as people tend to GO then WIPE then WASH   not wash then wipe then go there is a slight increase of risk if sally old enough to use tampons and or billy is old enough to do you know what with himself but...

in all honesty its NOT LIKELY but it's NOT IMPOSSABLE

If in doubt bleach wipe and or lysol  and ask your doctor/ health care practitioner 

also try a planned parenthood clinic  they often have very informative pamphlets on various std's how they can be xmitted and how long they can survive in an 02 environment

Please Please Please Err on the side of caution.","It is advisable to be very careful and avoid contact like kissing, touching, intercourse etc when infected with herpes virus . It can spread even when a person is asymptomatic. Hence, if a positive diagnosis exists its a good practice to wash the common contact areas such as toilet seats, faucets etc with bleach or lysol.

How do you stop being depressed?,"How long is a piece of string? Because that's what you're asking. Forget Jesus too. I mean faith has nothing to do with this. And why the heck do those trolls come here? Anyway, what it comes down to is what state your mental condition is in right now and how it impacts on your quality of life. Obviously it's not too bad at the moment because you've managed to cope with a big move, new city, and no friends around you. Doesn't sound like a person not in complete control of their life to me. Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?

So, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?

Overall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that. And if you think it does, well, perhaps you need to seek a different diagnosis. A professional one perhaps?

I also move to another county years ago and I know what you are talking about. just do not stay at home, go out.... force yourself to go out... go and do some volunteer job where you can find freinds or take classes... just get out Try reading this book: The only way that I have ever been able to get out of depression is when I focus on Jesus. I pray and talk to him. It seems to be the only way becuase other wise there isn't a whole lot of hope in life. You need to find something within yourself that makes you happy.  Don't search for other people or places to make you happy -- it has to come from within.  Once you find something within yourself that makes you happy, the friends and other things start to fall into place.  Search for your own hope in a higher power such as God. Find a hobby or interest that makes you feel good and do it -- this may take some trial and error, and that is okay!  Good luck and I will pray for you. I work at a counseling center, so obviously I feel counseling is a great tool, I don't know where you are located but if you live in an area that is currently short on sun light, their are alot of people whos depression is physical due to lack of light. Sleep is also a huge impact on mood, if you are not rested you will not feel one hundred percent. If this continues to be an issue, I would encourage you to seek counseling to try to find the deap root of the problem.","Follow up questions were asked what exactly the inquirer is depressed about why they refuse to take drugs, and if they have thought about taking some.",question,Defined as inquiry made for deeper understanding.,Seeking Understanding

Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.





Investigations
Some of the investigations used in gynaecology are:

abdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. 
vaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. 
blood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. 
hysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. 
laparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. 
MRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.


Diseases
The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:

cancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. 
incontinence of urine. 
amenorrhoea (absent periods) 
dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) 
infertility 
menorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. 
prolapse 
Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist. Gynaecology is typically a consultant specialty.

WHat kind of sit-up is the best and most effective?,"Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.  People dont say 8 because they dont believe it exists.  It does, and I have it.  I will assist further when you are ready.  Just make sure you rate me hehee... crunches!!! They've truly been my key to a ""six pack""! Knees up, bring head up until you feel the ""crunch"" and back down. Obliques-one knee up, hands behind head and opposite elbow up to knee. Give it a try. It hurts so good! Reverse sit ups are more effective.","It is suggested that incorporating a variety of exercises, particularly emphasizing crunches and oblique-focused movements, can be more effective in achieving a well-defined ""six-pack"" compared to traditional sit-ups. This approach recognizes the need for diverse and targeted abdominal workouts, suggesting that relying solely on sit-ups may not be as impactful for building core strength and definition.

how do i resist the urge to eat?,"Drink water. Often the 'thirst' mechanism is mistaken for the 'hunger' mechanism because they're quite similar. Other than hydration, I dunno... think of your goal (if you have one) and think about how much you want that goal. Get some close support. I'm here for you even if no one else is! People who lose weight are my heroes. Maybe you can't. Medical science lately has proving that some people always feels like eating. Maybe you should check that out at your med. don't resist, if you just ate and you feel guilty to eat again , try a snack,e.g fruit, something light. It's not so much how much or when you eat as it is what you eat - It's healthy to eat 4 to 6 small meals a day - Just make smart choices about what you eat.  I reccomend Body For Life - it worked for me. I knew nothing about diet or exercise. I didn't even know what a healthy portion was until I read that book. Eat tons of rice cakes and drink a lot of water. Just like you would resist anything else, the best way is to avoid it altogether. Avoid thinking about food, change your environment so that you can't smell, see, or hear about food. Also exercise is a good way to lower your hunger. Distract yourself. Find a hobby or something else to focus on.

Eat three square meals a day with maybe a healthy mid-day snack. That'll keep you healthy and satisfied. Do some physical activity. If you're depressed (which can cause overeating) go out and do something fun. Do not isolate. The only way to truly eat healthy is to keep away from bad food.  Get rid of the chocolate, twinkies, 
donuts,etc.  NO BUFFETS!!!  Do not skip meals either.  It slows your metabolism, and you get hungry and go for the first thing you see.  Follow these steps and exercise and losing weight will be no problem. don't resist the urge to eat. just make healthier choices when you eat and excercise regularly.","Drink water to stay hydrated and consider distinguishing between thirst and hunger cues. Setting goals and seeking support may help. If there's a persistent feeling of always wanting to eat, medical advice might be worthwhile. For those struggling with guilt after eating, opting for a light snack like fruit is suggested. Making smart food choices and following a structured meal plan, such as Body For Life, is recommended.

Why would a twenty year old woman not have a period for six months even though she is not pregnant?,"Have you lost a lot of weight recently, like dropped it from anorexia? There's your problem. A period occurs when the body can supposedly handle it (Like, enough body fat or something) so if someone stops eating from anorexia or something and loses a lot of weight quickly and keeps it off for a long enough time, then the body won't give a period.

Drugs, whether prescribed or recreational
Stress
Sexually Transmitted diseases.

In any case, don't post about it on the internet , GO TO A DOCTOR It can happen also if you have a very low bodyfat percentage, as is the case with some olympic gymnasts. You may be transgender. irregular? A lot of the hormones in different types of birth control methods also will cause a perfectly healthy woman not to menstruate.

excess body hair
bad recurring acne
skin tags
darkening of skin 
high blood pressure
insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes
mood swings
headaches etc...

If you don't know how to make yourself burp (like myself), get yourself some coke or 7up or sprite, anything gassy to make you burp faster :o) eat one teaspoon of sugar, will provide instant relief! Eat a spoonful of sugar quickly. Your senses will overload with the response from the receptors that the sugar triggered off, and you won't hiccup anymore. focus on your middle name for 5-10 seconds then say it OUT LOUD. if that doesn't work, use brother/sisters middle name. 2 methods, both work, but one is a bit difficult
1. Bite down on the middle part of a straw or pen or pencil in your mouth (the straw is not in your mouth like you are using to drink with, you are biting on the middle so the ends are outside your mouth near your cheeks).  Then drink a half of a glass of water.

Most normal (non-diabetc) individuals dont really go above 135 mg dl.

What is the average weight of a 12 year old 5 foot girl..I think my cuz is too heavy??,"Try using a BMI chart.  

BMI is Used Differently with Children Than it is With Adults
In children and teens, body mass index is used to assess underweight, overweight, and risk for overweight. Children's body fatness changes over the years as they grow. Also, girls and boys differ in their body fatness as they mature. This is why BMI for children, also referred to as BMI-for-age, is gender and age specific.1, 2 BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth charts. These charts are used for children and teens 2 – 20 years of age. For the 2000 CDC Growth Charts and Additional Information visit CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.

Each of the CDC BMI-for-age gender specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating specific percentiles. Healthcare professionals use the following established percentile cutoff points to identify underweight and overweight in children.

http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi-for-age.htm Well first off you really can't go by the charts tey use now because they are really outdated. So i wouldn't suggest using some kind of ""average weight"" to determine that. And you have to think about a lot of different factors. Ethnicity is one. Some ethnicities tend to be heavier than others. She may also have big bones (tho some people think that's a cop-out). And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her. But since she's twelve she's still growing so it may balance out for her.","To know a healthy weight, use a BMI chart or an average weight.",suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"

"is gastric by-pass the 
only solution for 
overweight ppl?","no there are multitudes of solutions from pharmisudics to health and diet... genetics and thyroid treatmens are a safer and more effective medical type treatment, however more costly and less accepted by insurace, try a healthy sport or active type lifestyle  alternative first not only is it cheaper but developes a sense of accopmlishment that lives on past the weight loss making it easier to retain your chosen weight rather then regaining it, definately stray away from weight loss drinks without active workouts as the weight reforms after giving it up ""remember that the fatty cells you deplete of water must be burned as well otherwise they retain water again rappidly after dieting making a month of work reappear three days after dropping the diet....     Look at pictures of gbypass procedures months after the treatment, the fat vanishes leaving massive ammounts of skin that can only be delt with by plastic surgery, again expensive and hard to get coverage for....  exercise releaves some of this problem as the skin is not retained quite as abundently...   most of all GOOD LUCK and dont give up, YOU CAN DO IT... i second syburry The good ol' tried and true healthy diet and exercise is still a good alternative.  The results take more time...but it's not as invasive as surgery.  Also, with diet and exercise, you make behavior modifications as you lose the weight, learning what works for you, and what doesn't. With the surgery, you immediately have to change your entire lifestyle.  Just some thoughts... Surgery is the last solution for obese people when everything else has failed. Making small changes in your diet and lifestyle alond with physical activity will give you the results you are wanting. It takes time but it is worth it. noooooooooooooo A hour a day of exercise, little diet change, because people tend to go back to thier old eating habits.

Why are people (me) plagued with dandruff? How the heck do I get rid of it? I have tried almost EVERYTHING!!?,"Dandruff is thought to be caused by a form of a skin condition called eczema, which causes increased shedding of normal scalp skin cells. Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse.
Here are some tips.
Learn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. 
Shampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. 
Cut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. 
Eat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. 
Get a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. But wear sunscreen on your face and body. I know for my daughter, we use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo. I hope it helps Talk to your doctor about things in your diet... Have you tried DERMAREST?  There is a shampoo and a lotion.  Use it for every other shampoo for the first week.

What is the normal TSH range for thyroid function?,"The normal TSH range is .200-5.5 (a high number is overactive; a low number is underactive) TSH is Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.  It is secreted through a feedback system in your body that looks at the amount of T3 and T4 hormones (the ones that are secreted by the thyroid gland) is circulating in your system. 

The range for a normal thyroid has varied over time.  Contrary to what the previous responder said, 0.2 is the right TSH measurement for a normally functioning thyroid.

The high end, which indicates a low-thyroid (hypothyroid) function has varied from 4 to 5.5 over the many years I have had mine measured.  5.5 is very high and indicative of a low  metabolism.  Many of the experts I have read say it should be below 2.

We live in an iodine deficient country.  The iodine in the soil between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalacians was depleted with the last ice age.  In the early 1900s there were such outbreaks of goiter, that the area was nicknamed the ""goiter belt"" and iodine was added to our salt.  It was also used as a conditioner in bread and in the red food dye that was used in hot dogs.  Since then they have lowered the amount in salt and done away with the other uses.

I use a relatively high dosage potassium-iodine supplement (similar in amount to that which the Japanese ingest daily with their diet) and have seen great improvements with my thyroid and with my metabolism.","For information purposes, the typical range for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is 0.2-5.5, where a higher number suggests an overactive thyroid and a lower number indicates an underactive one. TSH is released in response to the levels of T3 and T4 hormones from the thyroid gland. The accepted range for a healthy thyroid has changed over time. Contrary to a previous assertion, 0.2 is considered the appropriate TSH measurement for a normally functioning thyroid.

In type 2 diabetes, hypertension is often present as part of the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance also including central obesity and dyslipidemia. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension may reflect the onset of diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension substantially increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications, including stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and possibly neuropathy.

These days hernia surgery though is pretty straightforward, and if it is a small hernia, the surgery can even be done using a scope rather regular surgery.  If it's an inguinal hernia, trusses and corsets are sometimes used to manage hernias. They may work for a short time for small hernias. However, they are not a treatment for inguinal hernia. Trusses may increase the pressure within a hernia if a loop of bowel becomes trapped, resulting in strangulation; the blood supply to the loop of intestine can be cut off, killing the tissue.","In users expereince, one person explained that their doctor said there I son cure for hernia without surgery, they mentioned to not be scared of the surgery since her and four other people she knows have done it and lived.",experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"

Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"the depo shot has many side effects. the weight gain is due to certain hormones in the shot and as long as you are on the shot you will continue to gain weight. i personally do not recommend the shot due to many factors including the weight gain, spotting, and not to mention, when you are ready to have children and get off the shot, you will not be able to concieve for 12 to 18 months. my recommendation is to go of the shot. if long term birth control is what you want, you should go with the iud, it is more effective, when inserted it can last for up to 5 years, and it doesn't have the weight gaining side effect. genetics I had a friend that gained like 35 pounds and had spotting for 4 months straight, she was miserable--poor thing. That's why I never went on it--too many side effects!! After having my son, I went back down to right around my original weight.  I was then on Depo for 3 years, and in that time gained about 44 pounds.  The woman at the clinic told me that the weight would just start falling off after quitting the depo, however, it didn't.  I have been taking a prescription weight loss drug called phentermine, which works great, but isn't permanent.

Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?,"It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):

An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. 

There are two main types of ulcers- 

Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. 

Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. 

How do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. 

Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. 

There may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. 

There are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium ""H. pylori"" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. 

Some medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. 

Tense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. ""The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide"" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. 

Although uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. 



When a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. 

If you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet triggers Migraine Headaches This even happened to me!. The Usenet is filled with posts by people who have pinned their migraines down to aspartame/Nutrasweet consumption.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's breakdown products attack the bodies tissues and create Formaldehyde which builds up in the tissues forever. Remember the smelly, eye watering fumes from the frogs you dissected in school? They were preserved with Formaldehyde! Formaldehyde is thought to cause cancer.
The American Bottlers Association did not want the FDA to approve Aspartame/Nutrasweet because of what the test report showed. But the FDA approved it anyway!

2.  Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.  Soda or alcohol before sleep is the WORST!

Chinese Green Tea Benefits?,"There are three types of tea Black, Oolong, and Green tea. 

The difference between the Green tea and the others is that green tea is not fermented, thus keeping in the powerful antioxidants lost in the fermenting process. 

Green tea also contains polyphenols such as tannins (a nutrient antioxidant) catchins (EGCG which is a powerful antioxidant), and flavenoids, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin C. The antioxidants help your body fight against free radicals, which can mutate cells and make you sick. 

Numerous scientific discoveries have also linked green tea with remarkable disease preventative properties. Gargling with green tea has been shown to inactivate the flu virus, as has drinking a cup each day to activate the polyphenols (powerful antioxidants) that are also suspected to work well against both the cold and flu viri. 

As China permits greater access to its interior to scientists, reports grow of entire villages in the green tea growing regions where cancers and sicknesses are statistically lower than the national norm. Though such studies are best classified as emergent, green tea is becoming widely viewed as one of the superfoods of the future. 


Here are just a few known health benefits of drinking green tea: 


Boosts your immune system 
Lowers blood sugar 
Helps prevent cavities and tooth decay 
Slows the aging process 
Helps reduce the risk of cancer 
Lowers cholesterol 
Aids in weight loss by burning calories 
Reduces high blood pressure 
Prevents arthritis 
Reduces the risk of heart disease 
Reduces the risk of stroke 
Lowers the risk of blood clot 


Anti-Cancer Compound In Green Tea Identified Researchers at the University of Murcia in Spain (UMU) and the John Innes Center (JIC) in Norwich, England have shown that a compound called EGCG in green tea prevents cancer cells from growing by binding to a specific enzyme. ""We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs, "" Professor Roger Thorneley, of JIC, told Reuters.

The range for a normal thyroid has varied over time.  Contrary to what the previous responder said, 0.2 is the right TSH measurement for a normally functioning thyroid.

The high end, which indicates a low-thyroid (hypothyroid) function has varied from 4 to 5.5 over the many years I have had mine measured.  5.5 is very high and indicative of a low  metabolism.  Many of the experts I have read say it should be below 2.

hope it helps. agree doctor is best place to start. Treatment depends on the cause so it would be best to see a doctor to find out what the exact cause is, so the proper treatment can be started. You have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:

Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy
    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.

    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:

The patient's age 
The ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. 
The general physical and mental health of the patient 
The patient's physical strength 
Vertigo Medication
    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. 

    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.

    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.

    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.

Vertigo Surgery
    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.

    I know you're wondering is their a better way, a safer, faster or more efficient way you can permanently deal with your Vertigo.

Hope this helps you feel better.  signed  Bj Overview & Considerations

Fatigue is different from drowsiness. In general, drowsiness is feeling the need to sleep, while fatigue is a lack of energy and motivation. Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of indifference or not caring about what happens) can be symptoms of fatigue.

Fatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked.

The pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if you wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, you may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid. On the other hand, if you wake up with a low level of energy and have fatigue that lasts throughout the day, you may be depressed.
========================

Do you have any underlying illnesses? Is your thyroid funcioning correctly? Are you sleeping soundly? Each of these can lead to fatigue. Have your doctor do some tests for thyroid function and ask your mate if you snore, if so, have a sleep study done. If you have an illness, don't take the vitamins without your doctor knowing what you are taking. (For instance, Warafin+Vit.K= trouble.)

What is the best cure for endometriosis?,"There is no cure for endometriosis. But there are many treatments, each of which has pros and cons. It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so you can decide what option is best for you. 

Pain Medication 

For some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. 

Hormone Treatment 

For patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). 

Birth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can't take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. 

Danocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other ""barrier"" methods to prevent pregnancy. 

GnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. 

Surgery 

Surgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: 

Laparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well. If your doctor is going to treat the endometriosis during this surgery, he or she must make at least tw Pregnancy. However, it's hard to get pregnant when you have endometriosis. Be careful with Lupron Depot it lowers your hormones which can cause bone problems.

You can also have surgery to remove them but they'll just come back. See a Reproductive Endocrinologist and try to get pregnant. If you wait too long for pregnancy it may not happen.

Stay hopeful and prayerful. According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, 
""[h]ysterectomy is often indicated in the presence of severe symptoms with failure of other treatments and when fertility is no longer desired.""

For me, hysterectomy was a good option for controlling the pain of endometriosis, but it was only AFTER I had tried other treatments, such as Depo-Provera, Depo-Lupron, oral contraceptives (birth control pills, three laparoscopies with laser cautery to the endometriosis, pain medication, alternative treamtments including TENS, acupuncture, acupressure, chiropractic, and massage therapy.  

The BEST decision is the one that is best for the individual, and is decided between her and her doctor. First let me start off by saying that PREGNANCY DOES NOT CURE ENDO FOR ALL WOMEN, in fact for some women, their endo comes back after getting pregnant and others are not ready to get pregnant. I was diagnosed with endometriosis back when i was 13, and believe me, i wish there was a magical cure. I did a Distinguished Achievement Program project on endo in high school last year and researched various treatments. So far, the treatment that i have found works best for many women are using alternative treatments such as nutritional approaches. Many women have found relief by eating better such as ORGANIC FOODS, HERBAL REMEDIES, and lots of stress reducing exercise, such as yoga, meditation or even just running. The best thing to do is to research as much as you can. That is what helped me the most. It made me feel more in control of my endo. Different treatments work diversely for different women, work with your doctor and your own research to find out what works best for you, whether it be by medical, surgical, or alternative treatments.

If you get them on a semi regular basis, go to a clinic or your regular doctor, they have an anti-viral pill that will help you greatly. Abreva and such only dry out the blisters, so does ear wax believe it or not. Most adults have the herpe virus in their system, but a smaller percentage have symptoms. Ice also breaks the virus down quicker once you have the blisters, and aspirin will reduce pain and take the swelling down. Don't ever break the blisters they are freakishly contagious. Other than that, relax, they're a pain in the ass, but unless you have a problem with your immune system, you'll live. Cold sores are annoying but not something to worry about.  They are an infection by the HSV-1 virus.  Genital herpes is caused by a different virus, HSV-2. Cold sores are not a welcome addition, especially when you have to go out to party, meet friends, socialize or even a simple task as grocery shopping.

I worry a lot about my cold sores too. But the wise thing to do is find a remedy & take preventive measures.

1. Zovirax
2. Abreva (I use this)

Use a medicinal lip balm, drink lot of water, eat a healthy diet & exercise well. The cold sore would go away in 2 to 7 days. Don't worry about a cold sore, just drink more water and it'll go away, providing that you don't eat lots of junk food.","Cold sores, caused by the herpes virus, can be spread through oral contact with the affected area, so it's advisable to avoid oral intimacy during an outbreak. Stress can exacerbate outbreaks, so managing stress is essential. If you experience cold sores regularly, consider consulting a clinic or your doctor for antiviral medications. Over-the-counter creams like Zovirax or Abreva can help, and maintaining overall health through hydration, a healthy diet, and exercise is beneficial. Ice and aspirin can aid in reducing pain and swelling. Breaking the blisters is highly contagious, so it's crucial to avoid doing so.

what is orgasm?,"An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.

Dictionaries still give the subsidiary meaning, ""a similar point of intensity of emotional excitement,"" but as of 2005 this usage has become obscure. It can be startling to modern readers when encountered in older literature.


General
Both males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation You asked two questions that you might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps.

Many concepts may play a role in building orgasm, including thinking about making a baby, dominance and submission, etc.

True love might be a component of a good orgasm, but is itself different and in the long term more fundamental than the orgasm. Having orgasms with someone you love is wonderful, but the existence of the orgasms does not in and of itself serve to indicate whether the relationship will endure over a long term.","For information purposes, an orgasm is a pleasurable response to sexual stimulation, involving physical, emotional, and sometimes spiritual reactions. Both genders can experience it, but the specific response varies. It's the third stage in the human sexual response cycle, influenced by physical touch, emotional connection, mental intimacy, and complete involvement in the moment. Various factors like thoughts of procreation, power dynamics, and genuine love can contribute to the experience.

How would you know the difference between Pagets breast cancer & eczema?,"Go see a good oncological surgeon or skin doctor and have that looked at. While this implies it is not Pagets since you state that it is above the nipple. 

However be safe for see a doctor and get it checked. This is not something to wait on. 


PAGET'S DISEASE:

Introduction:
Paget's disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer in which the first clinical finding is usually scaling of the nipple skin. It may also be associated with nipple redness and burning. The diagnosis of this condition is typically made with a skin biopsy, which shows cells typical of this condition (Paget's cells). The ""good news"" about Paget's disease is that it is usually a ""curable cancer"". However, most cases of scaling and burning of the nipple are due to benign conditions which can be easily confused with Paget's disease.

Making the Diagnosis:
The major goal of this section is to help women (and their physicians) detect the early nipple changes associated with Paget's disease, and to help differentiate them from benign conditions. Making the diagnosis of Paget's disease is actually quite easy. We use a simple skin punch biopsy technique to remove a small piece of tissue from the area of the nipple with the abnormal changes. This procedure takes a few minutes to perform under local anesthesia and is painless. A small amount of skin and underlying tissues is removed and sent to the pathologist. In our experience with hundreds of cases it has proven to be 100% accurate. 

The first step in evaluating any patient with a change in the skin of the nipple is to obtain a careful history and to perform a careful breast examination, followed by a diagnostic mammogram. When performing a diagnostic mammogram the mammographer is informed about the posibility Paget's disease. Special films look for fine calcifications behind the nipple. If the mammogram is negative and our clinical suspicion is low, we usually suggest that the patient place a cortisone cream on the nipple for two weeks. 

If the condition has not responded completely to treatment in two weeks, we proceed to a skin punch biopsy. (a word of caution: we have seen cases of Paget's disease in which the mammogram was negative. The patient seemed to respond to treatment, but nipple changes recurred again in a few months. Therefore if a biopsy is not done, careful follow-up is recommended). Our rule of thumb: if in doubt, do a skin biopsy. Sometimes you can't just by examining it. Have adermatologist take a biopsy. That way you'll know for sure. see a doc","If there is uncertainty about whether the symptoms are related to Paget's breast cancer or eczema, it is strongly advised to seek medical attention promptly. Consulting with a qualified oncological surgeon or dermatologist is essential for a thorough examination and accurate diagnosis. In cases of doubt, a skin biopsy is recommended, as it can provide crucial information about the underlying condition. Seeking professional medical advice ensures proper evaluation and appropriate management based on the specific diagnosis.",suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"

is the dr atkins diet good for the health if you have a heart problem?,"I would say No. I can only tell you from personal experience. I remember when the Atkins diet was all the rage and everyone that couldn't loose weight wanted to try it. It did help some people, but I wasn't able to do the diet because of the kidney problem I have. The diet puts too much protein in your blood. You have to use good judgment when trying new things.

I've had my first period when I was 15 and have never had it since then. Is there an alternative to the pill?,"I used to get the Depo Provera shot, which is almost the same as the pill. I started getting it when I was 15, was on it for 2 years and then stopped. It took almost a year for me to get my period. I recently started again a few years ago and have been off of it for a little over a year and my period still isn't regular. My OB/GYN said that it can take up to 2 years for your body to rid itself of the birth control (whether it be the pill or the shot) and go back to normal. Just be patient. It'll balance out eventually. Early menopause is often an over looked cause. Birth control pills, also causes frequent missed periods.

Nevertheless, you should contact a Physician/Gynecologist in your area in regards to this issue so that he/she can rule out the possibility of a tumor. Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) is actually only a symptom resulting from a glandular malfunction, a chronic disease, a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, and tumors, or more importantly, a neurosis precipitated by emotional distress (unhappy love affair, divorce, and the like). However, hormonal treatment is most frequently employed when the possibility of tumor has been ruled out; while neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help, but even in this case, hormonal theraphy can be very helpful.

Again, much depends on the underlying trouble; some cases can be completly cured, for others medical help is limited. I recommend visiting eMedicine's Patient Education Center for a list of other Self-Care at Home options as well http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp .

What is the symptons of thicking of the heart?,"shortness of breath , feeling chest pain on the physical activity and change in e.c.g and x-ray , and shifted apex beat Thickening of the heart walls or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can sometimes go with no symptoms at all.  The thickening of the wall can be due to abnormal growth and arrangement of muscle fibers.  Because the heart is a muscle, overuse can also thicken the heart wall.  This is why the left ventricle - the chamber that pumps freshly oxygenated blood out of the heart - is usually the location of most thickening.  

Since this is a progressive disease, there can sometimes be no symptoms at all.  However, as the disease progresses, the thickened walls leave less room for blood in the chambers.  This can lead to distinct signs of abnormal heart function, which include breathlessness, angina (chest pain), syncope (fainting) after strenous exercise, pounding heartbeat, or fatigue.  The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is complicated with the condition left ventricular hypertrophy - which is an enlarging of the left ventricle.  This is common in athletic people, due to heightened conditioning.  However, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be properly diagnosed with an ECG and chest x-ray.

The best plan of action is to have a regular electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest x-ray in order to catch the disease before it gets unmanageable.","For information purposes, the thickening of the heart walls, known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, may show symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain during physical activity, and abnormal changes in ECG and chest x-ray results.

What is multiple sclerosis?,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.

The exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.

The inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.

Symptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).

Recurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.

Researchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.

People with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.

If your in Indiana. You might try getting on Indiana Medicaid. Contact the insulin manufacturer directly. My wife's aunt lost her insurance and got free insulin from them. There are various resources that you can probably consult to get assistance in paying for your diabetic supplies / insulin. A good starting point would be your local department of health location or local social services office. Both locations should be able to refer you to the appropriate program or service to meet your needs. Your local health department (depending on where you live) may also have what is known as a ""pharmacy access"" or ""pharmacy assistance"" program. These programs are in place to assist individuals of limited means access the necessary medications and pharmaceutical supplies to treat their medical conditions. 
There are probably several other resources you might consider contacting. Many Red Cross chapters offer such assistance, as well as private medical practices and even church groups. Don't be afraid to ask your primary care doctor or diabetic specialist for assistance in securing resources for this problem. Also, consider doing an internet search and check out some of the major pharmaceutical companies (Bayer, Abbott, etc.) Maybe they offer assistance as well. I am sure help is out there for you. 
Best of luck in your search... Generic insulin is fairly cheap, so if you really can't afford it, you are probably eligible for medicaid in your state.  However, Eli Lilly and Sanofi-Aventis are two drug companies that make insulin.  They probably have assistance programs, and if your income is below a certain level (usually 2x poverty) you would qualify for free drug.  Ask your doctor for the forms.

How can you keep someone from snoring?,"You can help prevent snoring by:
Losing weight (if necessary). 
Going to bed at the same time every night and getting plenty of sleep. 
Sleeping on your side, not on your back. Try sewing a pocket in the middle of the back of your pajama top, putting a tennis ball into the pocket, and stitching it closed. This will help keep you from sleeping on your back. 
Avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives before bed. 
Quitting smoking. 
Raising the head of your bed 4 in. (10 cm) to 6 in. (15 cm) by putting bricks under the legs of the bed (using pillows to raise your head and upper body will not work). 
Promptly treating breathing problems, such as a stuffy nose caused by a cold or allergies. 
Using nasal strips, which widen the nostrils and improve airflow. The following are questions most often asked of doctors about snoring and snoring treatment. Easy, sleep on your belly They sell these little tape things that fit over your nose.  They really work and are not uncomfortable.

www.breatheright.com/index.asp Tickle their mustache!

Actually, those little breathing strips really do work. I had a BAD problem with snoring and tried everything.

A mouthpiece -- no go
Nasal Strips -- not a chance
Sprays -- hah don't even try that snake oil

What did work was something that my wife suggested and I have yet to snore since.

Before going to bed, put a piece of candy or cough drop between your cheek and gum in the back of your mouth (sugarless so not to rot your teeth)

The muscles in the face holding the candy in place will not allow you to snore. Try it when you are awake and you will see you cannot make a snoring sound.

The only downside is once or twice a month I do have it fall out and when it lands in the wrong place (on the pillow and then roll over on it having it stuck to my cheek) it can be a little messy but it does work. I used to snore in the winter because the air was so dry at night.  My husband got me a humidifier which we keep in our room every night, and I haven't snored since.  

You might also try having him sleep on his side or stomach.  You are much more likely to snore when lying on your back. lol well what i did when i was married lmao too funny every time he would snore i would jab him in the ribs then after 2 weeks of learning better he stopped lol it really worked for 7 years no snoring Yea you can keep him in cabinet,

What is the EASIEST way to loose weight for a female. I need quick weight loss.?,"Drop your caloric intake to 1,000 calories a day - double your usual workout - don't eat any sweets or sugars - eat tons of fruits and vegetables (look up ""negative calorie"" foods) - and don't eat out.

How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.

Lowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.

However...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  

If you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing! They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though. If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  

I had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  

Eating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP. The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed.

Don't be scared of the surgery...I lived to tell about it, and so did two co-workers and 2 friends! Usually surgery is not done unless the hernia becomes strangulated.  These days hernia surgery though is pretty straightforward, and if it is a small hernia, the surgery can even be done using a scope rather regular surgery.  If it's an inguinal hernia, trusses and corsets are sometimes used to manage hernias. They may work for a short time for small hernias. However, they are not a treatment for inguinal hernia. Trusses may increase the pressure within a hernia if a loop of bowel becomes trapped, resulting in strangulation; the blood supply to the loop of intestine can be cut off, killing the tissue.","For information purposes, surgery for hernias is typically reserved for cases where the hernia becomes strangulated.

what is a cure for TINNITUS?,"Home Treatment

The following tips may help you reduce symptoms of tinnitus.

-Cut back on or eliminate alcohol and beverages containing caffeine.

-Stop smoking and stop using smokeless tobacco products. Nicotine use makes tinnitus worse by reducing blood flow to the structures of the ear.

-Limit your use of aspirin, products containing aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen.

-Exercise regularly. Exercise improves blood flow to the structures of the ear. However, avoid extended periods of exercise, such as bicycle riding, that keep your neck in a hyperextended position. For more information, see the topic Fitness. 

While waiting to see whether tinnitus goes away, or if your health professional has advised you that your tinnitus will be present for a long time, try these methods to cope with the constant noise:

-Limit or avoid exposure to the noises you suspect are causing your tinnitus. If you cannot avoid loud noises, wear protective earplugs or earmuffs.

-Try to ignore the sound by directing your attention to other things.

-Practice relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation, or yoga. Stress and fatigue seem to make tinnitus worse.

-Quiet rooms can cause tinnitus to seem more distracting. Background noise may reduce the amount of noise you hear. Play music or white noise when you are trying to fall asleep or anytime you find yourself in a quiet place. You may consider buying a machine that makes soothing sounds, such as ocean waves.

-Try the herbal supplement ginkgo biloba. Some studies suggest that it may help relieve tinnitus, but other studies do not show a benefit. Further studies are needed to determine the best dosage. That first answer had a lot of hints and yet not the one that I know works - and that is to drink more water.  Dehydration is the basic cause of tinnitus.  Start drinking the 8 glasses (that's about 2 quarts a day).  Coffee doesn't count, it's a diuretic and depletes your system of water.

Without enough water, you can't wash away the toxins from your body.  For me, it's the easy answer that works.","For information purposes, ginkgo biloba, an herbal supplement, has been studied for its potential in alleviating tinnitus.

Where is the gum?,"The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets (the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth. Your dentist would measure this with a probe.

If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss  which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). 

I emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.

Hope this helps!","The most effective way to prevent periodontal problems is through regular brushing and, crucially, flossing (at least twice a day for two minutes each). Emphasizing the importance of flossing is essential, as it targets the areas between teeth where food and bacteria often accumulate. Flossing aims to thoroughly clean the surfaces where two teeth meet, requiring a technique that follows the sides of the teeth for optimal plaque removal.

after having showers with hot water or getting hot(due to blankets) during sleeping i get an allergy?,"I suffer from the same thing.

It's hives.  

It can be an allergic reaction - if you're having other symptoms of allergies like watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, then it could just be an extension of whatever you're allergic to.

But hives can be brought on by heat without an allergic reaction.  Nobody knows for sure why it happens in the absence of other allergies.  But heat brings blood to the surface of the skin and allows hives to develop.

If you scratch them, they will spread.  Sometimes mine itch when they're just flat red wheals, and sometimes they don't... but if I so much as touch a wheal before it swells, POOF! Not only does it swell and itch a lot worse, but it tells all its friends and neighbors, and it spreads like wildfire.

I have had chronic hives for 6 months now - due to allergies.  I take a Claritin and a Singulair every day, and it still doesn't completely get rid of them.  I am undergoing allergy shots.

One other thing you can do is to get some Ivarest. You can find it at Walgreens. I've tried everything else on the market, and only Ivarest keeps the hives down for longer than an hour or so.  It's a little more expensive, but a tube will last me several weeks, instead of just a day or two like a tube of Benadryl cream.

You can also take Benadryl before a shower to help keep the hives down to a minimum.

What are some signs of a stomach ulcer?,"The most common tell-tale signs is constant heartburn.  If it occurs regardless of what you eat or drink and when and occurs day after day, it could be an ulcer.  The best advice is to see your doctor if you have any doubts.

Note:  Ulcers have only one cause or source: PORK.......thats right, it is the only way you can get an ulcer.  Eating poorly, excessive drinking, stress are only things that will make an ulcer worse.

I wish you the best. The systems of stomach ulcer are sharp and severe pain and discomfort in the upper part of the abdomen. Gastric ulcer pain usually occurs an hour after meals and rarely at night. Duodenal ulcer pain usually occurs between meals when the stomach is empty. The pain is relieved by food, especially milk. As the disease progresses, there is distension of the stomach due to excessive flatulence, mental tension, insomnia, and gradual weakening of the body. Blood may also be detected in the stool. I have seen and experisenced a few of the symptoms. Acid reflux is one. Constant and consistant heartburn is another. Especially if the heartburn gets so bad yo can't sleep at 3 AM then its time to go get checked out my friend. Don't wait untill the Ulcer bleeds. this is NO JOKE. My father had one for a long time and he was on Tagament for so long. Ulcers are no fun! Go see your phasycian and do yourself a massive favor! You'll be thankful you did. Peptic ulcer is usually a non-malignant ulcer of the stomach (called gastric ulcer) or duodenum (called duodenal ulcer). About 4 % of gastric ulcers are caused by malignant tumour, which is why ulcers of stomach are controlled. Duodenal ulcers are non-malignant. By far most instances are now known to be due to Helicobacter pylori, a spiral-shaped bacterium that lives in the acid environment of the stomach. These ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as Aspirin and other NSAIDs.


Signs and symptoms:

Abdominal pain; 
Hematemesis (vomiting blood); 
Melena (tarry feces due to oxidised iron from hemoglobin); 
Weight loss; 
Rarely, an ulcer can lead to a gastric or duodenal perforation. This is extremely painful and requires immediate surgery. 
A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer are NSAID (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone).

In patients over 45 with more than 2 weeks of the above symptoms the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by EGD (see below).

The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid is secreted, or after the meal, as the alkaline duodenal contents reflux into the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would manifest mostly before the meal — when acid (production stimulated by hunger) is passed into the duodenum","In users experience, an individual has observed and personally experienced symptoms related to gastric ulcers and share the symptoms and the importance of timely medical intervention including persistent acid reflux and constant heartburn.

How do you treat dry lips?,"lip gloss won't do anything except slick your lips.  Actually, most of them could be detrimental.  Balms are the way to go.  I use chapstick.

My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble?,"Give it time. With an ear infection you usually have some fluid build up behind the eardrum. Even if the fever is gone, the fluid (and the bacteria in it)can still be there. So the hearing should improve as the fluid goes away and make sure your daughter finishes the full course of the Amoxicillin, or the bacteria in the fluid can start multiplying again and she can end up even sicker than before. I learned this the hard way. If she has had alot of ear infections, i would ask your doc to send her to a specialist. That happened to me over time, and i knew that i couldn't hear well, and it turns out that i had a cyst in my ear canal, and the cyst had damaged my hearing, so they took out 2/3 bones because they weren't fixable.I am doing fine, but it should have been taken care of along time ago. Go and get checked. go see a doctor, by no means at all should you be asking for a diagnosis on Yahoo! answers. also make sure she finishes her meds...thats most important! Like anything else, nothing goes away overnight. Give it time. I've had an ear infection a few years ago and the doctor gave me amoxicillin. I had to take it for about a week to 10 days for it to fully go away.

Call your doctor if you have more questions and/or concerns. I once had a ear infection in both ears and when it cleared up It felt like I had cotton in my ears and couldn't hear very well like i did before.  Being that I worked in the nursing filled I knew somehting was not right. I went back to the Doc and he gave me something to DRY it up.

In one individual's case, a cyst in the ear canal led to damage to the hearing bones, requiring the removal of two-thirds of them.

what is the best way to cure dry skin?,"best stuff is jergens. I was once on hydrocortizone. if thats how you spell it. It didnt help, but jergens did. Use the one for extremely dry skin, the best they have. and use it every day. hydrocortizone is a medicine that doesnt cure you. it only keeps you on their medicine so that they can make more money off of you. Different things work for different people, but previous postings are good. Try a humidifier - I didn't used to like them, but there are many kinds to choose from now. Next, try the shorter, less frequent, less hot showers, using Dove creamy sensitive skin body wash, followed by Lubriderm sensitive skin lotion applied within 3 minutes of showering. Bag/udder balm also works for a lot of people... but even that may mean trying different brands. 

I had tried just about everything, and finally went to a dermatologist. Those recommendations (above) all helped.  Vaseline and other petroleum-based products feel great for a short time, but are ultimately drying. If you take hot showers you should either shorten the amount of timw you are in the shower or lower the temparature of your water. You just the amount of soap needed... using too much can dry your skin out, also use some kind of lotion or even that baby oil gel while your skin is still damp from the shower. For your feet use ""Udderly Smooth"" you cann find it in like Walmart and Walgreens and stuff... the bottle has cows print on it... that stuff works the best glycerine based soaps,shampoo or shower gel Run a humidifier in your home in the winter.  You wouldn't believe the difference this makes.  Winter air is dry, and it's even worse when you've got indoor heat running.  So keep the air in your home moist.

And then of course, a good moisturizer, like Neutrogena or Jergens helps a lot.  Use 3 times a day.   

But you really won't need as much active lotion care if you just keep the air less dry -- your skin will heal as you sleep in the healthier air in your home.  Sharper image has some good ionizing humidifiers.  I stopped needing lotion and chapstick altogether once I discovered this trick a few years ago. call your man, ask him, but tell him the truth Baby oil or vasileine vaseline or pure vitamin e oil whenever u get a chance smashed bananas and honey sounds gross but it works!!!!

how long does it take to see definition in body muscles after starting a diet and exercise program?,"How Soon Can You Expect to See Results?

The Most Frequently Asked Question of Any Beginner

Do you ever wonder why so many people join a gym in January and then it’s business as usual the end of February or mid-March?  There’s a couple of reasons.  

First, working out is something you do as a habit.  Not just something you do for four weeks.  Many of the people, who join up, have no idea what’s going on.  They just sign up.  Hand over a year’s worth of dues and get on a machine.  The lucky ones get a 30 minute overview of the gym with a personal trainer.  And maybe the trainer is good.  And maybe not.  They have somewhat of a goal.  Lose weight.  Get bigger.  And they don’t have any idea of what their body can do.  After about 4-8 weeks of this, it’s old.  Not exciting anymore.  They don’t really like exercising anyway.  Now going to the gym is a chore that ranks with paying bills.  The excuses start (have to work late, pick up the kids, my <insert body part> hurts, I’m tired) and it’s over.  

Second, if you don’t see results fast and I mean FAST, it’s over.  If you don’t lose 60 lbs in 4 weeks, then working out has failed you.  If you didn’t gain 40 lbs of muscle in a month, then you are a hardgainer and will be doomed to lead the life of a skinny guy forever.  There’s a whole group of people that want to obtain a certain body image.  But 16 years is way to long.  They want to be slim and trim or big and buff in 2 months for some occasion.  Or maybe they saw all the ads over the holidays, looked at themselves and said, yeah why not.  I’ll just join a gym.  Fitness is easy.  Nothing to it.  I’ll do a little here and there.  I’ll do cardio.  I’ll quit eating.  

They quit too.

So just how soon can you expect to see results?  

On average, if you change your diet, follow a moderate to intense routine and introduce some interval training cardio, you will see results in as little as 4-6 weeks.  Nothing earth shattering mind you but changes.  Slow progress.  You might even start to feel internal body changes within a week.

The key to getting the results you want as fast as possible is to monitor where you are now, where you want to be then and what you are going to do daily to get there.  

Those that think results only come at the gym really never see results.  And they quit.

Those that understand fitness is 24x7x365, will see results in 4-6 weeks.  When you wake up and eat breakfast or don’t eat, that is fitness.  When you consistently don’t get the rest you need, that is affecting your goals.  When you have no way to measure progress, it’s very difficult to tell if you are going anywhere at all.  

Just because you cannot “see” something does not mean it’s not there.  Every time you pick up a weight or get on the cardio machine, jog or run, you are making changes in your body.  You might not see it but I bet you can feel it.

Bottom line, there’s no magical number of when you might see some progress of your efforts but on average, in four to six weeks you can begin to see your efforts pay off if you understand that fitness is a lifestyle and not just another diet or thing you do when you have the time.","Many individuals join gyms in January but often lose interest by February or March due to various factors. For some, working out needs to become a habitual part of their lifestyle, not just a short-term commitment. Many newcomers lack a clear understanding of fitness goals, engaging in routines without proper guidance or realistic expectations. The pursuit of rapid, dramatic results and a desire for a specific body image within a short timeframe contribute to high dropout rates. Fitness progress typically takes time, with visible changes appearing in 4-6 weeks through consistent efforts in diet, intense workouts, and interval training. Understanding that fitness is a 24/7 lifestyle involving factors beyond the gym, such as diet, rest, and daily commitment, is crucial for achieving long-lasting results.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
What is the average I.Q? How much is the maximum? And the Lowest?,"Ok...  The average person is said to have anywhere from 100-110 IQ.  Any lower than 75, you are clinically mentally disabled.  The requirement for MENSA used to be 150, but I think that they have actually raised the bar since I last checked.  140-150 is very good, your problem solving skills (the make up of a standard IQ test) is top notch.  I myself was tested at 147, but since the test varies, so do the results.  Any change of about 15 points is normal between results. Tests done in the US usually set the average to 100.  140 and above might be considered genius.  France and the US usually run close to each other.

Can I spread the herpes virus to my children?,"In some situations yes you can The answer is yes! 

Herpes simplex viruses may be passed from person to person by contact with an infected individual's sores, either on the mouth or on the genitals. Herpes simplex infections may also be passed through saliva or genital fluids of someone who is infected with herpes but has no active symptoms at the time of contact.

See source link for more on herpes. You need to be especially careful, and you need to stop kissing your kids for a while. If you want to, you can wipe off surfaces, but usually the virus isn't transfered by touch unless your kids like to suck their fingers. Just be careful. ok here is the deal herpes has 2 types simplex a and simplex b i dont remember which is which but as i understand it they are both pretty much the same with the exception that one is oral the other is genetal 

ok now this may get a little descriptive if so then please forgive me 

if you have the oral kind   i believe simplex a  which is esentially what coldsores are then you prolly have already given it to your kids if you have ever kissed them 

if it is simplex b  the genetal kind you more or less need to engage in what i will refer to as a high transmission risk activity, i'm going to assume you know what i mean by that, with your kids for them to be high risk of getting it 

also of note if you have simplex a you can give simplex b to somone else by giving them oral pleasure the same is also true if they have b then you can get a. 

now i'm going to assume you have b and you are worried about giving your children b since you seem concerned about your kids i'm going to assume you are not engaging in high risk activities. which leaves other things like faucets and toilet seats

TOILET SEATS  can be a form of transmission   however it is VERY unlikely EXTREEMLY FEW reported cases  as most std's do not survive long in an oxygen environment.  it is even less likely for boys as they tend to sit less than girls. girls also have easier access on a toilet seat to a likely point of infection  (eg the mucus producing membranes on pretty much the entire vaganal wall) howerev again there is not a high risk you would really need to leave some residue or secretion on the toilet seat that would be sat upon within a reletively short period of time in a manner that is not likely to be sat upon 

so rule 1 lysol and or bleach wipe the toilet seat when youre finished all the time not just during outbreak as herpes can be passed even when you are not simptomatic

the faucet even less likely of b to b xmition possable b to a xmition  

from genetal area to hand then reducing amount hand to faucet (increased exposure to o2 environment) then enters ""sally or billy"" turns on faucet then touches mouth or gets glass of water wich touches mouth...    very unlikely that sally or billy will turn on faucet then be touching genetal region as people tend to GO then WIPE then WASH   not wash then wipe then go there is a slight increase of risk if sally old enough to use tampons and or billy is old enough to do you know what with himself but...

in all honesty its NOT LIKELY but it's NOT IMPOSSABLE

If in doubt bleach wipe and or lysol  and ask your doctor/ health care practitioner 

also try a planned parenthood clinic  they often have very informative pamphlets on various std's how they can be xmitted and how long they can survive in an 02 environment

Please Please Please Err on the side of caution.","Herpes simplex viruses can be spread through contact. It can be transmitted by kissing, genitals, saliva, contact with sores on the body and contact with surfaces shared with infected persons. A non symptomatic host can transmit herpes as well.  Herpes has 2 variants, namely, simplex A and simplex B, the latter being localized to the genital areas. People affected with any one variant can transmit the other variant depending on the contact being casual or sexual. There exists a remote probability of spreading herpes through surfaces like toilet seat and faucets, but the virus don't survive for long in oxygenated environments.

What can I use to help me fall asleep and stay asleep?,"well i listen to music. NyQuil. But if you take it, don't make any plans. It's a coma in a bottle. A few things to try:

Chamomile tea, followed by a lavendar inscence, or candle.

Orange blossom tea, followed by perhaps a soothing wite tea candle/scent.

2 very good methods i use.

Another good combination, which helps in breathing, ect would be a mixture of Lavendar and Camphor inscence chased with a lavendar or orange blossom tea. 

White Tea straight is a bit harsh to drink, but mixed with milk and honey tastes wonderful, and is quite calming.

Dont forget that you need to have a scent while you sleep if you find it hard to sleep.  Don't also to forget that a completly dark room will keep you awake, leave some light filtering into the room, not on you, but indirectly.

Also, ensure that your beddings are clean, and that the room is at a moderate temprature, not too hot, not too cold :)  It is best to keep a mild breeze, from say a ceiling fan on low, or a regular fan on low pointed away from the bed.  Keep the air indirectly on your sleeping space, it keeps your mind calm, as you focus unconciously while you sleep on the air flow.

Some good tips for ya :) Good eating habits, excersize, and Melatonin.  You can get it across the counter. Chamomile tea is excellent for this!  I usually can drop off within 15 minutes of a nice steamy cup.

You may also want to try L-ornithine.  It is an Amino Acid.  You can find this at any natural food store. 

But as always....first check with your doctor or any other source you trust to make sure these products are right for you.

Is there a home remedy to detox from nicotine ?,"I found this - I hope it helps!

The Recovery Process

Successful nicotine dependency recovery is in maintaining the motivations, dreams and patience needed to allow: (1) the physical mind time to re-sensitize itself and re-adjust to functioning normally again; (2) the subconscious mind time to encounter and re-condition the bulk of its nicotine feeding cues that triggered brief anxiety episodes in an attempt to gain compliance; and (3) the conscious mind time to either allow years of defensive dependency rationalizations to fade into distant memory, or the intelligent quitter time to more rapidly destroy their impact through honest reflection. 

The ex-smoker will find themselves enjoying a deep and rich sense of inner quiet, calmness, and tranquility once their temporary journey of re-adjustment is substantially complete. 

The body's nicotine reserves decline by about half every two hours. It's not only the basic chemical half-life clock which determines mandatory nicotine feeding times, when quitting it's also the clock that determines how long it takes before the brain begins bathing in nicotine free blood-serum, the moment that real healing begins. 

It can take up to 72 hours for the blood-serum to become nicotine-free and 90% of nicotine's metabolites to exit the body via your urine. It's then that the anxieties associated with readjustment normally peak in intensity and begin to gradually decline. 

But just one powerful ""hit"" of nicotine and you’ll again face another 72 hours of detox anxieties. It's why the one puff survival rate is almost zero. None of us are stronger than nicotine but then we don’t need to be as it is simply a chemical with an I.Q. of zero. It does not plot, plan or conspire and is not some demon within us. Our most effective weapon against it is, and always has been, our vastly superior intelligence but only if put to work. 

Nicotine Replacement Products

The key to nicotine dependency recovery is not in dragging out the 72 hours of detox by toying for weeks or months with gradual nicotine weaning or other creative means for delivering nicotine. The nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) industry want smokers to believe that a natural poison is medicine, that its use is therapy, and that it is somehow different from the tobacco plant's nicotine molecule. The truth is that the pharmaceutical industry buys its nicotiana from the exact same growers as the tobacco industry. They want you to believe that double-blind placebo controlled studies proved that NRT doubles a cold turkey quitters odds of quitting and that only superheros can quit without it. The truth is that their studies were not blind as claimed, and that all but a tiny sliver of earth's successful quitters are quitting entirely on their own. Here are a few facts that those selling creative nicotine delivery devices would rather you not know: 

Nicotine is a psychoactive drug whose ""high"" provides a dopamine ""aaahhh"" sensation and an adrenaline rush. Would you have been able to tell, within 5 minutes, whether the gum or lozenge you'd been given contained the nicotine equilivent of smoking two cigarettes or was instead a nicotine-free placebo? So could they. A 2004 study found that NRT studies suffered from massive wide-spread blinding failures (May 2004) 
A nicotine smoker's natural odds of quitting for six months, entirely on their own, without any products, procedures, education programs, counseling or formal support is roughly 10% (June 2000) 
Those using the over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch or gum as a stand-alone quitting tool have only a 7% chance of quitting smoking for six months (March 2003) 
Up to 7% of OTC nicotine gum quitters are still chronic users of nicotine gum at six months (May 2004). Question: isn't 7 minus 7 still zero? (May 2004) 
36.6% of all current nicotine gum users are chronic long-term users (May 2004)

1. Stay off nicotine - there are plenty of methods to stop the addiction, but pick one.
2. Fill your system with good stuff: clear air and healthy food. Do this by taking deep breaths and exhaling completely, and eating only healthy foods (including snacks) for at least a week.
3. Get plenty of vitamin C, which is supposed to specifically help you rid yourself of nicotine. Take some vitamin C tablets and/or foods with vitamin C. As with any vitamin, don't overdose.","It is advisable to employ different methods to stay off nicotine like a healthier diet, deep breathing and taking medication (post consultation) to help with the addiction.

The first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.

Fat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.

So if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. 

The most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). 
You have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. 

If you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: 
  
1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) 
  
1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) 
  
1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)
  
Your abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. 
  
Increase metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!

This means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! 

Here's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).
  
Warm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes 
  
Perform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) 
  
perform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) 
  
Repeat this process from 6-10 times 
  
Cool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  
  
Maintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!

To stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?

Give your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). 

Most people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! 

I'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat.

Is it true you should not work out the same muscle group every day?,"Working out the same muscle group every day just makes the muscle larger or blukier. Tissue are packed into highly arranged bundles. When you work out you are actually contracting and relaxing the tissue that makes up the muscle. As you move your muscle some of the tissue break down causing the pain and friction. Resting a day between working out just gives time for the muscle to repair the broken down tissue. The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when you work out the next day you rely on other tissue  that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that you are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if you do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down. Doctors don't usually recommend you to work out the same muscle group every day because they believe that the muscle should be fully repaired before you work out. In the Army, they would have us do an Easy Day, then a Hard Day.  Easy Day was basic warm-up followed by soccer or whatever.  Hard Day was warm-up followed by multiple mile run, workout in the gym, whatever.  They feel that it is required.

As for the muscle burn, that happens because you are burning the muscle and fat, to my understanding.  Depending on whether you are trying to build-up your muscles, gain tone, or lose weight, you will get different effects for different types of workouts. yes, you are suppose to work a different muscle group everyday. Because you don't want your muscles to get used to the same thing everyday then it becomes routine your body will be so used it that it will not burn fat and build muscle as much as it would if you change it up everyday. If you don't feel burn after your exercise you could be doing them wrong you should feel some burn. I workout twice a day everyday, and there are days when i will work out my arms in the morning and then come home and workout my arms again in the evening. they say you should work out your muscles as much as possible for they burn the most calories. Also, about the burn in your muscles, i don't  feel the burn all the time, but i can guarantee if you, if you are doing the exercise right, then you will see results within 6 weeks. It is always best to rotate the muscles you excersize.  Reason is that you do not want to end up 'muscle heavy', IE:If you only work one set of muscles, let's say in your arms, you will have tremendous arms, and not tremendous anything else.
Once the burn leaves, you are keeping them fit, but not adding to the bulk of the muscle.  hope this helps Ding!  What winnie said.  All you are doing working the same muscles every day is damaging them, you get a much better benefit if you rest them and allow the muscle to heal.

And that ""if you do not feel the burn"" is the old philosophy of ""No paing, no gain"" which is basically now to be considered a load of horse crap.","In users expereince, one individual engages in twice-daily workouts, sometimes focusing on the same muscle group, such as arms, in both the morning and evening. The belief is that working out muscles as frequently as possible maximizes calorie burn. Despite this approach, the individual does not always feel the burn in their muscles. The idea behind the intense workout routine is to enhance calorie expenditure and potentially promote muscle development. However, it's important to note that rest and recovery periods are crucial for muscle repair, and overtraining without adequate recovery can lead to fatigue, injury, and diminished results.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neuron cells in the spinal cord and brain, which ultimately results in paralysis and death. The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. 

In 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.

Recent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS","For information purposes, the ""differential diagnosis"" section of the eMedicine write-up on Multiple Sclerosis explores conditions with overlapping symptoms. Some of the listed differentials include Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Bell Palsy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, HIV Infection and AIDS, Lumbar Disk Disorders, and Stroke. ALS, characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration leading to paralysis and death, shares symptoms with MS. The discussion delves into the genetic aspects of ALS, highlighting the SOD1 gene's association and its role in removing harmful superoxide radicals. The link between familial ALS and chromosome 21 is noted, emphasizing the challenges in pinpointing the exact molecular cause of the disease. Current research explores antioxidant treatment for ALS, though further investigation is essential for developing promising therapies.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"

Fatigue and exhaustion are your body’s way of telling you that enough is enough! It means that the energy stores in your body have been depleted—often by stress, worry, and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Unfortunately, most of us combat this fatigue with “artificial” energy products (stimulants) that give a temporary boost but leave us more exhausted afterwards.

Fatigue is the feeling of extreme tiredness or loss of energy due to physical strain, mental strain, or illness. Typically, fatigue is easily remedied through additional rest and relaxation. However, extreme or chronic fatigue is a more serious form of fatigue that can be caused by one of a number of diseases. Among these fatigue-causing illnesses are chronic fatique syndrome, diabetes, depression, and more. If you always feel tired and suspect some abnormal underlying cause, consider seeing a doctor when convenient.

General fatigue can affect your daily life as well as those people who surround you and should be taken seriously. Difficulty getting restful sleep or constant fatigue during the day can be helped with natural remedies in addition to certain medications. Fatigue medications should be prescribed by a trained health care practitioner. Herbal medicines, natural therapies, and other alternative means can be explored more freely, but not all remedies are guaranteed to work for every person. Certain anti-fatigue products will help you be more alert and in tune with your surroundings. Find ways to help treat your fatigue right away

Possible Causes of Fatigue
Though little is known about fatigue prevention and treatment, fatigue may be related to a variety of medical and physical conditions and psychosocial factors. Fatigue can be caused by anemia or associated with major organ dysfunction, including severe heart or lung disease, kidney failure, or liver failure. Hypothyroidism (insufficient production of thyroid hormone) and adrenal problems, even if mild, can cause fatigue. Neuromuscular disorders, malnutrition, infection, dehydration or electrolyte disturbances can also be associated with fatigue, as well as sleep disorders, immobility and lack of exercise, chronic pain, or the use of centrally-acting drugs (e.g., opioids). Psychosocial factors associated with fatigue are anxiety and depression, stress, and those related to the reactions of others to the fatigue. Drink LOTS of water.  Dehydration is currently the cause of most fatigue like symptoms. a glass of warm milk and sleep.","Fatigue is a common signal from the body indicating depleted energy stores, often caused by stress and daily pressures. While occasional fatigue is remedied with rest and relaxation, chronic fatigue may be linked to underlying illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes, or depression. Seeking medical advice for persistent fatigue is crucial, as it can be associated with various conditions like anemia, heart or lung diseases, thyroid or adrenal issues, neuromuscular disorders, and more. Dehydration is identified as a prevalent cause of fatigue-like symptoms. Exploring natural remedies, herbal medicines, and medications under professional guidance can aid in managing fatigue.

How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?,"I have not had a panic attack in four years.  Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me.  I sincerely hope this helps! you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you I would recommend Louise Hay's ""Self-Esteem Affirmations"" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway"" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches you to repeat ""I'll Handle It"", which is very helpful during a panic attack.

I have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me. meditate Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.

In the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web. I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called ""Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry"" that outlines various strategies.

First, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.

Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.

Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.

Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over ""Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon."" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).

Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.

Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? 

People do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!","In users expereince, one individual has experienced relief from panic attacks for over three years, finding help in suggestions like psychological therapies and medication.

What are some signs of a stomach ulcer?,"The most common tell-tale signs is constant heartburn.  If it occurs regardless of what you eat or drink and when and occurs day after day, it could be an ulcer.  The best advice is to see your doctor if you have any doubts.

Note:  Ulcers have only one cause or source: PORK.......thats right, it is the only way you can get an ulcer.  Eating poorly, excessive drinking, stress are only things that will make an ulcer worse.

I wish you the best. The systems of stomach ulcer are sharp and severe pain and discomfort in the upper part of the abdomen. Gastric ulcer pain usually occurs an hour after meals and rarely at night. Duodenal ulcer pain usually occurs between meals when the stomach is empty. The pain is relieved by food, especially milk. As the disease progresses, there is distension of the stomach due to excessive flatulence, mental tension, insomnia, and gradual weakening of the body. Blood may also be detected in the stool. I have seen and experisenced a few of the symptoms. Acid reflux is one. Constant and consistant heartburn is another. Especially if the heartburn gets so bad yo can't sleep at 3 AM then its time to go get checked out my friend. Don't wait untill the Ulcer bleeds. this is NO JOKE. My father had one for a long time and he was on Tagament for so long. Ulcers are no fun! Go see your phasycian and do yourself a massive favor! You'll be thankful you did. Peptic ulcer is usually a non-malignant ulcer of the stomach (called gastric ulcer) or duodenum (called duodenal ulcer). About 4 % of gastric ulcers are caused by malignant tumour, which is why ulcers of stomach are controlled. Duodenal ulcers are non-malignant. By far most instances are now known to be due to Helicobacter pylori, a spiral-shaped bacterium that lives in the acid environment of the stomach. These ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as Aspirin and other NSAIDs.


Signs and symptoms:

Abdominal pain; 
Hematemesis (vomiting blood); 
Melena (tarry feces due to oxidised iron from hemoglobin); 
Weight loss; 
Rarely, an ulcer can lead to a gastric or duodenal perforation. This is extremely painful and requires immediate surgery. 
A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer are NSAID (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone).

In patients over 45 with more than 2 weeks of the above symptoms the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by EGD (see below).

The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid is secreted, or after the meal, as the alkaline duodenal contents reflux into the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would manifest mostly before the meal — when acid (production stimulated by hunger) is passed into the duodenum","The importance of consulting a doctor early on is advised owing to the seriousness of ulcers. Certain medications, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids, are associated with peptic ulcers, they could be avoided. Additionally, it suggests that individuals over 45 with symptoms persisting for more than two weeks should undergo prompt investigation through EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) due to the increased likelihood of peptic ulceration.",suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"

"what to do to prevent vomiting, on long drive to hills?","i used to live in the middle of nowhere Southern Appalachia - an hour away from work and friends.  its a long, curvy drive up and down mountains.  since i was a kid, i've gotten car sick easily.  here's what works for me:

don't eat immediately before the drive, but make sure you have some food in you.  eat or drink some ginger (i like candied ginger).  if its nice out, crack the window a bit. if its cold, crack it every once in awhile, especially if you start to feel sick.  keep a bottle of water handy and take a sip from time to time.  other than that, keep your eyes forward, don't look out the sides.  and try to look at distant objects instead of up close ones.

works for me.  although i almost always got a little nauseas on the drive, i never vomited.  wish is could say the same for my dog. Before a one hour while going to long drive. I take vomit medicine and not too much eat. There is a tablet called avomine which helps you prevent vomiting. The most effective cure, is ginger pills.

What should I do about chapped lips?,"The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. 
-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. 
-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. 
-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. 
-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. 
-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. 
-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. 
-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin.

How can I best help someone who is bi-polar?,"Understand it as well as possible and then be supportive of treatments. This FAQ's might help you.

1. What is bipolar disorder? 

Bipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. 

2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? 

Bipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. 

3. What is rapid cycling? 

The term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. 

4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? 

Bipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. 

5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? 

Bipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. 

6. How is bipolar disorder treated? 

The cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. 

Psychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes.

I wish he was only just saying this. Do you know what makes you believe you have an implant in your tooth and are being followed?  Is there any reason someone would be following you?

Believing you're being followed doesn't make you a Schizophrenic anyway....it might be indicative of being paranoid.  Lots of people experience some paranoia along the way.  It's particularly found in alcoholics and drug users....

I'd suggest you visit a therapist, psychiatrist, or psychologist and talk about those feelings to see if you can get beyond them.  It's not a nice way to live...always looking behind you.

Good luck. I suggest that you visit your dentist and have the tooth evaluated for your own mind.  Your wife has some reasons of concern.  Why are people following you?  Are you an important target for people to spend time following you?  After the dental visit, you should seek mental health evaluation for your feelings that people are following you.

what does it mean when diastolic blood pressure is over 100?,"It means you need to quit eating salted food, lose weight, and exercise. If this is not a once-off measurement, but that your diastolic pressure has been checked a few times and it is definitely still over 100 mmHg, it means that you have high blood pressure.

Normal blood pressure is now considered as a systolic blood pressure of below 120 mmHg plus a diastolic blood pressure of below 80 mmHg.

Diastolic blood pressure is the blood pressure when your heart is relaxed in between the beats; compare that to the blood pressure when the heart is beating, which is called the systolic blood pressure. That is why the diastolic blood pressure is always quoted lower than the systolic blood pressure. Which of the two is more important is still up for discussion. Well, I know that 140/90 is considered to be the beginning of high blood pressure. What Is ""Normal"" Blood Pressure?

There are several categories of blood pressure, including:

Normal: Less than 120/80 
Prehypertension: 120-139/80-89 
Stage 1 hypertension: 140-159/90-99 
Stage 2 hypertension: 160 and above/100 and above

what are the advantages of contact over glasses?,"looks I wear both.  Contacts are great for rainy days (so you don't have to deal with glasses foggin up or rain drops on your lenses) and sunny days (for sunglasses).  However, you put them in everyday and take them out everynight.  If you get one tiny (miniscule - as in you can barely see it without a microscope) scratch or rip, you will have to through it away.  And your contact could fall out at any blink (nothing is more fun than having 20 people on their hands and knees looking for something the size of a dime on shag carpet!). Contacts are definetly more expensive and your eye exam has to be done yearly.  Contacts can be painful if your eye gets irritated.  All in all glasses are a lot less hassle, but contacts are great to have too.  That's why I use both. I am a dangerous driver when I only wear glasses- my peripheral vision is extremely poor.  That is my number one advantage! For some, it's simply worth it for the vanity of it.  Some people refuse to be able to see clearly simply because they think glasses make them look dorky.

I couldn't wear contacts for a while because my eyes didn't like them.  I did but my eyes would burn and stayed red.

With the newer lenses that allow more oxygen to get to my eye, I can wear contacts with little problem.

Glasses can fall off.  They can get caught on clothing.  You can't just run through the rain to get into a building without having to stop to wipe your glasses or put them back on.  If you have to carry big things, you can expect your glasses to get hit.  Glasses get dirty.  Glasses fog up when you go from cold to hot temps.  Forget sunglasses: I had a pair of nice glasses with the transition lenses and they worked for a while but not long enough to justify the cost.

Contacts are far less work to me.  They require cleaning and good hygiene.  But once you have them in, they are far less work.  If you don't constantly rub your eyes, you don't have to worry about them falling out much.  They are harder to put on than glasses but are far less work during the day.

It does take a little time to get used to them but once you are, they add new freedoms that glasses can't offer.

Just my opinion.","Contact lenses have a more expensive overall cost, requiring regular eye exams, constant replacement if scratched and might potentially causing discomfort if the eyes get irritated.

"I'm going to a chiroprator for the first time on Friday, what should I expect?","They will probably do xrays.  Adjust you, which feels great.  I like the warm ultrasound on my neck and the pulse machine.  Also you may be sore the next day. Well, it won't be a walk in the park when he works on you, depending upon your problem. Still, when I go, I feel almost instant relief when he adjusts my neck. The main thing to remember is to be sure to ice down as he tells you following the procedure or else you will swell & be rather uncomfortable. It is also a good idea to take it easy...& I mean EASY... after the procedure. This allows everything to relax into place & you will feel MUCH better for it.

Normally the first visit is to take x-rays & determine the problem so you are sort of eased into the visit by doing that. They'll probably do some kind of adjustment but won't always do something major the first time out...it all depends upon the problem, really.

Overall, the first time or three are somewhat uncomfortable & can be even more so afterward but, once you've gone a few times you'll find you lok forward to it :)

Extended periods of sauna or whirlpool exposures or prolonged vigorous exercise may actually cause this temperature to rise.

Sex after baby?,"Just about every set of new parents go through this.
There is so much going on with your wife right now, and not just with taking care of the baby.  Her hormones are still trying to get back to normal, and her body is still recovering.  The whole hormone thing can really kick her butt.  She can be upset, and not have any idea why.
The best thing to do is take it slow, and give her time.  She is probably tired, and doesn't feel very sexy.  Also, if you are making sex an issue, it will tend to make things worse.
She needs you to be sweet to her, tell her much you appreciate her, tell her that she is a great mommy, and how proud you are of her.  Volunteer to do a chore that is normally hers.  Rub her feet, or give her a backrub without making it lead to anything else.  You will be very surprised how much this will work.  Remember that foreplay starts for the woman first thing in the morning. I'm not a guy but I can try and offer some advice. First of all make sure you are both keeping the communicatioin flowing between you. Do you help her with the baby? Do you try and take some of the load off of her so she can relax a little? 
Does the baby always sleep with you guys? Try and make sure that the baby is not always sleeping in the room. Maybe put the baby down a little early, draw a nice bath for her, let her relax a bit and then try to get the sparks going between you two. 
It is very important that your wife keep your relationship as husband and wife as a priority above the children. (That is in the bible)

Good luck and I hope that time is all she needs to adjust to having a new baby. Congrats as well! Depending on how old the baby is, it may just be post partum depression, or a facsimili of. She may or may not be sexually aroused by you or is not feeling especially sexy yet. Always reassure her that she is still very sexy to you, and don't make your compliments happen only when you are looking for sex. Do them all the time, without expecting recourse to your comment. Well, I dont know about this as I dont have one personally, but I will say that there is this stuff called ""Black Pearl"" that I think that you can buy at GNC and it is a libido enhancer and it can be for you or for her.  It is supposed to really really enhance sex drives.

Sometimes a new mom just needs someone that's got her back, no expectations. Eventually.. she'll get back into it :-) Two years ago after the first baby..everything start looking different from what I though it would be..Baby change everything!Before baby make love almost every day.After the baby was born I start feeling guilty for some reason.My husband become frustratet a little bit.We talked about situation and I discovered that all I need from him is to pay more attention to the baby( not me).I had more time to relax and more time to start thinking about my husband...I pay him off all he did for me ...at night.","The individuals share their experiences related to their sex lives after having children.

How could you know if a person needs depression pills? Or what are the feelings of a depressed person?,"If you are depressed at the moment some of the following symptoms may sound familiar: 

You feel miserable and sad.
You feel exhausted a lot of the time with no energy .
You feel as if even the smallest tasks are sometimes impossible.
You seldom enjoy the things that you used to enjoy-you may be off sex or food or may 'comfort eat' to excess.
You feel very anxious sometimes. 

You don't want to see people or are scared to be left alone. Social activity may feel hard or impossible.

You find it difficult to think clearly.

You feel like a failure and/or feel guilty a lot of the time.

You feel a burden to others.

You sometimes feel that life isn't worth living. 

You can see no future. There is a loss of hope. You feel all you've ever done is make mistakes and that's all that you ever will do.
You feel irritable or angry more than usual.

You feel you have no confidence.

You spend a lot of time thinking about what has gone wrong, what will go wrong or what is wrong about yourself as a person. You may also feel guilty sometimes about being critical of others (or even thinking critically about them).
You feel that life is unfair.

You have difficulty sleeping or wake up very early in the morning and can't sleep again. You seem to dream all night long and sometimes have disturbing dreams.

You feel that life has/is 'passing you by.'

You may have physical aches and pains which appear to have no physical cause, such as back pain.


Consult ur psychiatrist and get the treatment..

PLZ dont treat urself. You would see a specialist and ask for a diagnosis. That's how you could officially tell if a person was depressed and needed medication and/or therapy. There are free depression screenings. I have one on my web page. Your physician or a therapist can diagnose you. Only a licensed professional can make the diagnosis, not a friend or a do-it-yourself.

The primary feelings of a depressed person are apathy, lethargy, fatigue and withdrawal. In teens, it can be irritablity. i think depression is a term used too loosely, if someone is badly depressed they lose all motivation and daily functions are a chore, usually they find it difficult to even get out of bed, if this is the case they need help immediately but sometimes people may feel really down and totally drained and this may just mean that they are lacking some vital vitamin or mineral in their body or may have another condition like under/over active thyroid or diabetes or someing like that either way they should see a doctor you know if they're always depressed

Major depression or depression disorder. Manifested by symptoms that interfere with the ability to work, study, sleep eat and enjoy once-pleasurable activities.
Dysthymia. Involves long-term, chronic symptoms that aren’t as disabling as those of major depression but that interfere with functioning well or feeling good.
Bipolar disorder, or manic-depressive illness. Characterized by cycling moods, with severe highs (mania) and lows (depression). In the 
manic cycle, people may be extremely active, talkative and energetic.

SYMPTONS
Persistent sad, anxious or “empty” mood
Feeling pessimistic, hopeless
Feeling guilty, worthless, helpless
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed
Fatigue, loss of energy
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions
Sleeping too much or too little, middle-of-the-night or early-morning waking.
Reduced appetite and weight loss, or increased appetite and weight gain.
Thoughts of death or suicide
Restlessness, irritability
Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain.

is taking aspirin an effective treatment for high blood pressure????,"Aspirin does not treat blood pressure at all. high blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease. aspirin is a treatment for ischemic heart disease. No It prevents the clotting of blood in the bllod vessels in general ,especially in the blood vessls of the Heart in particular ,thereby prevents the Heart attack as much as possible. Absolutely not.  Go to Web MD and look it up.  Aspirin is only good for thinning the blood and helping pain and swelling, helps to prevent clots from forming.  Has nothing to do with B/P. Asprin thins the blood which in turn does lower bloodpressure somewhat, due to thinner blood can make it past blockages easier If it is not too high it is effective, but if it is really high you will have to take a perscription Not really -- but that does not mean it is without cardiovascular benefits.

If you have hypertension, consult with your doctor.  Depending on the readings, the doctor may start with diet/exercise or may they presecribe medications.  Most cardiologists now tend to use diuretics for most patients as they tend to be safe, effective and inexpensive.  That may be supplemented with other meds such as ace ihibitors, beta blockers or calcium channel (inhibitors?).

Controlling your hypertension is very important and needs to be done under the active supervision of a MD.   You may also be directed to take a low dose of aspirin -- research suggests the lowers the risk of heart attacks. Taking aspirin before bedtime - but not at other times of the day - may help lower blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension. According to researchers, it seems that people who take aspirin first thing in the morning get virtually no blood pressure benefit from the drug.  Before starting to take any type of aspirin, please talk to your doctor about this.  This should not be a substitute though for regular high blood pressure medications.","Aspirin may have cardiovascular benefits, including potential blood pressure reduction, especially in mild cases. However, for effective hypertension management, consulting a doctor is crucial. Treatment may involve lifestyle changes, prescription medications like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers. Aspirin usage, even at low doses, should be discussed with a healthcare professional. It may be recommended as part of a comprehensive approach to reduce the risk of heart attacks.

"which is worse, childbirth or getting kicked in the testicles really hard?","You cannot compare the two at all- they are completely different, esp when there are so many different pain management solutions to childbirth, to the point that there would be no pain at all. Seeing my Wife give birth to two children I would rather get kick in the nutts then birth a kid. Generally childbirth lasts for hours while a kick does not usually go on for hours and hours its just a one time thing. Fortunately, being a woman, I'll never find out. 

I think the results of childbirth, however, are much more pleasant :-) Something we will never determine until an accurate pain meter is invented (I doubt such a thing can be done).
Men cannot give birth and women do not have ""testicles"". Watching pre labor alone was enough to not want to do it.

How do i lose 10lbs in 2 wks?,"the main thing is to eat less calories than you spend(...)
each 3500 calories equals 1 pound, the maximum healthy weight loss is 2 pounds per week, but if you have lots of extra weight to lose when you go on a good diet it is so much possible you lose more than 2 pounds per week.
go on a diet in which you eat enough amounts of carbs, fat and proteine based on your height and goal weight, take multivitamins daily, drink at least 64 ounces water daily (the more the better), exercise for at least one hour 4 days a week, drink lots and lots of green tea( I believe it helps a lot), try the ""K challenge""--->have K cereal(original or red berries) for two meals (the instruction is on the box).

Why do I have body odor that won't go away?,"It's the food you're eating!!!

Try eating more greens and fish.

I went to Germany, and wow did they smell bad. Germans mainly eat meat and beer.  This clogs up you're pores and produces smells like the food you've consumed. Funky meat (like hotdogs and hamburgars) produces B.O. 

Then I went to Greece straight from Germany.  In athens, they mainly eat lots of greens (some call these vegtables),seafood, and Vino (wine).  The Greeks smelt really good. . . Yummy, I'd take a yummy smelling Greek God any day!

To get more greens, you can eat vegtables, go to Jamba Juice and take shots of Wheatgrass, or buy chloriphorm in a pill. . . I really suggest just eating more vegtables. You need to use deodorant every day. It could be from your diet.  Also try to get more water, plain water not soda or tea or flavored water in your diet and see what that does. Your body uses skin to release toxins stuck in the body. The toxins smell. 

Evaluate what you are eating. Processed foods have lots of chemicals that smell bad when digested.

Study some inner body cleansing. Simple start: get a colonic, find Christian herbalist to help cleanse your body. Focus on parasites first. Some estimates state that 85% of North Americans have some parasite. They produce ammonia and other waste products that clog up the body and create bad smells (toxins trying to leave the body through your skin) Then work on cleansing other organs, liver, kidneys etc.","For information purposes, diet plays a crucial role in body odor, as highlighted in the passage. The author contrasts the unpleasant smell associated with a meat-heavy diet in Germany, particularly funky meats like hotdogs and hamburgers, with the fresher-smelling Greeks in Athens who consume more greens, seafood, and wine. The text emphasizes the body's use of skin to release toxins, with a recommendation to evaluate and improve dietary choices. It suggests avoiding processed foods due to their chemical content and advocates for inner body cleansing, starting with colonics and seeking herbalist assistance.

Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"the depo shot has many side effects. the weight gain is due to certain hormones in the shot and as long as you are on the shot you will continue to gain weight. i personally do not recommend the shot due to many factors including the weight gain, spotting, and not to mention, when you are ready to have children and get off the shot, you will not be able to concieve for 12 to 18 months. my recommendation is to go of the shot. if long term birth control is what you want, you should go with the iud, it is more effective, when inserted it can last for up to 5 years, and it doesn't have the weight gaining side effect. genetics I had a friend that gained like 35 pounds and had spotting for 4 months straight, she was miserable--poor thing. That's why I never went on it--too many side effects!! After having my son, I went back down to right around my original weight.  I was then on Depo for 3 years, and in that time gained about 44 pounds.  The woman at the clinic told me that the weight would just start falling off after quitting the depo, however, it didn't.  I have been taking a prescription weight loss drug called phentermine, which works great, but isn't permanent.

Specifically, it is suggested to opt for the intrauterine device (IUD), which is deemed more effective, has a longer duration of effectiveness (up to 5 years when inserted), and lacks the weight-gaining side effect associated with the Depo shot.",suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"
what is a trans sexual???,"A transsexual is an individual who plans to have or who has had SRS (sexual reassignment surgery) or hormone therapy.  Contrary to popular belief they don't all want to transition b/c they're a man trapped in a woman's body, or a woman trapped in a man's body.  Nor does everyone know from a very young age that they want to transition and not every transsexual hates the body they were born with.  There are complicated reasons other than that related to an individual's desire to transition.  Transsexuals can be heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or any other sexuality.  Eventually however their bodies will reflect their gender with the help of the methods listed above and this new body is different from the sexed term assigned to the body  and the person at birth. I just want to clear up some misconceptions here:

A transsexual is a person who self-identifies as a person of the opposite sex from what they were born as.  Both male-to-female and female-to-male transexuals exist, but MTF is more common.

It takes hormone therapy and surgery to completely change one's sex.  People who choose to undergo the transistion are often required to live with their new identity for a year before doctors will allow any surgery to be done.  People who have not had the surgery are called pre-op transexuals, as opposed to post-op.

Transexuality actually has nothing to do with who the person is sexually attracted to, only the sexual identity of the person.  This is probably the hardest thing to grasp for non-transexuals as our sexual preference is the most over-riding part of our sexuality.  

What Dr. Dee refers to is a pre-op transexual.  They normally can't ""play a man"", as the breast tissue has already increased to a size that would require disguise to revert back.  

However, people can be born as hermaphrodites (people with both male and female sexual parts).  Often when this occurs, the doctor doing the delivery will arbitrarily assign gender - sometimes not even informing the parents. A transsexual (sometimes transexual) person establishes a permanent identity with the opposite gender to their assigned (usually at birth) sex. someone who has had a sex change operation and now has sexual organs of the opposite gender. its when some 1 goes from male 2 female or vice versa. On Opra there was a woman who did not like men so she became 1....u kno 4 the girls...and 2 be honest..? she (he) looks better as a man well I heard that it is almost like bisexual but they change tastes often like they go from girl to boy or boy to girl...not really sure though Well in simple words, a transexual has breasts  like a woman, and a functional penis, like a man. They can play either the man or the woman.

 They gone through a surgery because god made either  a man or woman, not 2 in 1. Someone who has undergone a sex change.  See the Webster's link below. i think it is when people had a sex change? like they were male then female? TRansexual is when a male or female decides to be the opposit sex. This often goes to the extreme level where its done with an operation. 

So pretty much when a guy or girl wants to change their sexual preference they are transexual.

Heterosexual- Attracted to opposite sex
Homosexual- Attracted to the same sex
Trassexual- When sexual identity is changed .
bisexual- Attracted to both same and opposite sex.
Asexual- Don't like sex at all. 
Then there is another one where a guy would wanna stick it in anything and a girl would want anything stuck in her but i don't know the exact term for that.","In users experience, an individual heard that being transexual is similar to that of someone bisexual but changes their gender often.",experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.

From webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition.

In between times, surround yourself with a healthy circle of friends...ones that aren't after you for money, a place to sleep, or smokes. Find other young mom's who are doing the same thing. Find a MOPS group...Mother's Of Pre-schoolers. It's a mother's group, who meet regularly (weekly) and get together with their children, sharing tips, recipes, cleaning ideas, and each others problems. Once a month, they hire a babysitter and do something together, like go to a movie, bowling or a number of other fun, wholesome activities. Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get you out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours. If your child is old enough (as young as 3), you can enroll them in Headstart. There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things. Some people will find an grandmother-type person, who is still very active, and you help each other. She can help you with your child, being a surrogate grandma, and she can teach you what she knows. You can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to you and your child. When you get involved, you teach yourself and you teach your child, and you'll end up showing your child how to give of himself to those less fortunate. <*)))>< Geez I would say listen to starshadow and not the guy who accused you of being selfish. He obviously has no clue about life. 
  Being lonely is no fun, and having a child to take care of no matter the joy does not take the place of adult companionship..
  I think star had a good point there, go out to where your children go, go to church, there are plenty of moms just like you and even a few dads.
 Keep looking and get out, watch out that you don't keep yourself too much at home, that is unhealthy for your sanity... Take care and Happy New Year Find a good hobby girl.  Are you creative?  Maybe try painting, reading a good novel, or scrapbooking.  Make a scrap book of your child. I was a single mom for about 4 years. I am now married, but at the time it was pretty hard.

how to treat eczema?,"My step-daughter has it and we control it with doctor prescribed creams in the winter.  During the summer, she swims a lot, so that seems to keep it away.

While eczema cannot be cured, most cases can be controlled by:

Making lifestyle modifications to prevent flare-ups 

Seeing a dermatologist for treatment 

Using medication as prescribed 

This approach tends to prevent inflammation and itching and keeps eczema from getting worse. Dermatologists recommend that treatment be sought at the onset of signs and symptoms. When therapy begins early, it often reduces severity and duration. 

Diagnosis
Effective treatment requires a correct diagnosis; however, it is not always easy to distinguish one type of eczema from another or from similar skin conditions. Dermatologists have the medical training and experience needed to determine if eczema is present — and if present, which type. To diagnose eczema, dermatologists examine the skin and ask about: 

When the skin condition first appeared 

Signs and symptoms, such as long-term pruritus (itching) or recurring dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) 

Certain circumstances that may aggravate the condition, such as excessively dry air or emotional stress 

Family medical history, including questions about close blood relatives who have asthma, hay fever, or eczema 

Personal medical history 

In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other causes. 

Allergies are more common in individuals with atopic dermatitis, and allergy testing may be considered when a patient has:

Significant indications of allergies, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and colic in infants) or hives 

Been poorly responsive or unresponsive to treatment 

If a food allergy is suspected, testing for allergic reactions to eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, and tree nuts (e.g., walnuts, cashews) are usually performed as these foods are responsible for 85% of all food allergies. A positive allergy test does not confirm the food allergy. A suspected food allergy must be subjected to a ""challenge."" A challenge is conducted by having the patient eat the suspected food and observing the patient for a reaction. Even a challenge does not guarantee that the food is the trigger because: 1) another trigger may be present and causing the reaction or 2) the patient’s reaction may be delayed. Consequently, allergy testing has limited value. However, it is useful for eliminating foods that cause immediate and severe reactions or welts.

Dermatologists may use a “patch test” to determine if the patient has allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema that develops when the person has an allergic reaction to a substance that contacts the skin. The reaction generally occurs a few hours after the substance contacts the skin and settles down within a few days if the substance does not contact the skin again. A patch test exposes the patient’s skin to minute amounts of substances that may have caused the reaction. When the test is positive, the dermatologist must determine if the chemical caused the dermatitis and if so, if it is the primary cause or an aggravating factor. Further testing may be necessary.

Treatment
Once eczema is diagnosed, a treatment plan will be made based on:

Type and severity of the eczema present 

Age, health, and medical history (including presence of other conditions) 

History of previous treatment 

The primary goal of treatment is to relieve discomfort by controlling the signs and symptoms. Since eczema is usually dry and itchy, most treatment plans involve applying lotions, creams, or ointments to keep the skin as moist as possible. The treatment plan also may require lifestyle modifications and using medication as directed. 

A topical (applied to the skin) medication may be prescribed to help relieve itching and inflammation. Another way to treat the itch is with a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching is severe, a sedative antihistamine may be recommended. Skin infections caused by bacteria, such as staphylococ You have to detoxify your body from toxins. All diseases are results of your lifestyle. Once you get detox your eczema will dissapear. Go to the doctor. Get a prescription, or keep your skin well oiled,(moistened) to keep it from constant break out. you should never at any circumstances let your skin get dry. Try the over the counter Cortizone, or A&D ointment.","Eczema, though incurable, can be controlled through lifestyle adjustments, dermatological care, and medication adherence. Seeking treatment early is advised to minimize severity and duration. Diagnosing eczema involves skin examination, history evaluation, and sometimes skin biopsy. Allergies, common in atopic dermatitis, may be assessed through testing, but results are not conclusive. Dermatologists may use a patch test for allergic contact dermatitis. Once diagnosed, treatment plans consider eczema type, severity, age, and medical history. The primary goal is symptom control through moisturizing applications, lifestyle changes, and prescribed medications, including topical treatments and antihistamines.

do you ever get food stuck in your tonsils?,"yes!!!!! its normal No its absolutly not normal you really need to get checked with a docter. You might need to get them removed.

The best way to get them out is to gargle with some salt water. Yes, food gets stuck in the tonsils, and sometimes that causes those smelly white ""thingies"". if your tonsils are big or one is bigger than the other and if food gets caught in them then they are infected but unless they are causing you pain then theres nothing to worry about. Your tonsils are the first point for infection coming into your body sop they catch everything, hence the swelling and the big holes in em that catch food and contain pus.

The little white ""thingies"" that are being referred to are called tonsilloliths.They are caused by trapped food particles and bacteria and can indeed smell very bad.But other than stinking,they are not harmful.As far as the size of your tonsils,mine change frequently and oddly it has sometimes been when they are on the small side when I've been the most sick (frequent tonsilitis,strep throat,sore throat,etc.) 
However ,I wouldn't rush and have them removed ,because they are there for a purpose. even though it's gross it is very common. however i'm wondering about the one tonsil bigger than the other thing. is it larger because its red and inflamed (usually happens when you get a sore throught) or is it always like that?","Some of the causes for tonsilloliths, commonly referred to as smelly white 'thingies,' include trapped food particles and bacteria accumulating in the tonsils.

can kissing cause HIV  infection ?,"Not dry kissing but wet kissing. NO!  HIV is not transferable through saliva.  HIV is only transferable through blood and sexual intercourse. no Nope, only exchange in blood and/or semen. Not unless your mate has it. But it starts out with AIDS wich is bad but not so bad and then turns into HIV which is terrible. Theoretically yes. The probability of it happening through this method are very low, but still plausible nonetheless. I tend to believe the Centers for Disease Control. It is this and other public misconceptions of the HIV virus that seems to be allowing it to propagate rapidly throughout the world. We need to educate ourselves on this epidemic before it is too late. Only if you have open sores in or around your mouth will you be subject to the virus, but no you can't contract the HIV virus from saliva. absolutely not I know several people who are HIV+, and the odds in catching HIV from kissing are far the than winning the lottery--when you actually need the money. the most likely way for you to catch it by kissing is if both people have cuts in their mouths. even still, with combination therapy (that is, if they are on [or have taken] meds), this occurence most likely WILL NOT HAPPEN.  however, if it goes past making out, then you gotta be careful. One more thing, while kissing an HIV+ person may be safe, you may want to watch out for anyone who may have MONO or HERPES. Causes of HIV/AIDS 
Cause of HIV/AIDS: AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick. 1 

Cause statistics for HIV/AIDS: The following are statistics from various sources about the causes of HIV/AIDS: 

57.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through sex with other men in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
24% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
9.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
38% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
59% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
Cause details for HIV/AIDS: HIV disease is characterized by a gradual deterioration of immune function. Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called ""T-helper cells,"" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. 

A healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. 

Most scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS.

What are some signs of a stomach ulcer?,"The most common tell-tale signs is constant heartburn.  If it occurs regardless of what you eat or drink and when and occurs day after day, it could be an ulcer.  The best advice is to see your doctor if you have any doubts.

Note:  Ulcers have only one cause or source: PORK.......thats right, it is the only way you can get an ulcer.  Eating poorly, excessive drinking, stress are only things that will make an ulcer worse.

I wish you the best. The systems of stomach ulcer are sharp and severe pain and discomfort in the upper part of the abdomen. Gastric ulcer pain usually occurs an hour after meals and rarely at night. Duodenal ulcer pain usually occurs between meals when the stomach is empty. The pain is relieved by food, especially milk. As the disease progresses, there is distension of the stomach due to excessive flatulence, mental tension, insomnia, and gradual weakening of the body. Blood may also be detected in the stool. I have seen and experisenced a few of the symptoms. Acid reflux is one. Constant and consistant heartburn is another. Especially if the heartburn gets so bad yo can't sleep at 3 AM then its time to go get checked out my friend. Don't wait untill the Ulcer bleeds. this is NO JOKE. My father had one for a long time and he was on Tagament for so long. Ulcers are no fun! Go see your phasycian and do yourself a massive favor! You'll be thankful you did. Peptic ulcer is usually a non-malignant ulcer of the stomach (called gastric ulcer) or duodenum (called duodenal ulcer). About 4 % of gastric ulcers are caused by malignant tumour, which is why ulcers of stomach are controlled. Duodenal ulcers are non-malignant. By far most instances are now known to be due to Helicobacter pylori, a spiral-shaped bacterium that lives in the acid environment of the stomach. These ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as Aspirin and other NSAIDs.


Signs and symptoms:

Abdominal pain; 
Hematemesis (vomiting blood); 
Melena (tarry feces due to oxidised iron from hemoglobin); 
Weight loss; 
Rarely, an ulcer can lead to a gastric or duodenal perforation. This is extremely painful and requires immediate surgery. 
A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer are NSAID (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone).

"I just puy braces on, and i feel really BAD?","It might sound silly, but just forget about your braces!  If you walk into school tomorrow and instead of complaining about your braces or trying to hide them, just smile and talk with your friends and don't worry about them.

What is strabismus?
If your baby's eyes seem to point in different directions or not focus on the same object, he may have strabismus — a lack of coordination between the eyes. They may appear to be ""crossed"" or one may seem to drift inward, outward, or upward. Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then).

What is amblyopia?
Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye. This can happen if your baby's eyes are misaligned or if he can't see as well with one eye because of nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or something that's blocking clear vision in that eye, like a cataract or a drooping eyelid.

About 3 to 6 percent of children under the age of 6 develop amblyopia. Treatment is most successful before age 5 or 6, although recent research shows that even older children may recover their vision. If ignored, though, amblyopia can result in permanent vision loss. This sounds like a vestibular problem to me.  The nerves in your ears that help you with balance also have connections to the muscles that move your eyes.

what is a cure for TINNITUS?,"Home Treatment

The following tips may help you reduce symptoms of tinnitus.

-Cut back on or eliminate alcohol and beverages containing caffeine.

-Stop smoking and stop using smokeless tobacco products. Nicotine use makes tinnitus worse by reducing blood flow to the structures of the ear.

-Limit your use of aspirin, products containing aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen.

-Exercise regularly. Exercise improves blood flow to the structures of the ear. However, avoid extended periods of exercise, such as bicycle riding, that keep your neck in a hyperextended position. For more information, see the topic Fitness. 

While waiting to see whether tinnitus goes away, or if your health professional has advised you that your tinnitus will be present for a long time, try these methods to cope with the constant noise:

-Limit or avoid exposure to the noises you suspect are causing your tinnitus. If you cannot avoid loud noises, wear protective earplugs or earmuffs.

-Try to ignore the sound by directing your attention to other things.

-Practice relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation, or yoga. Stress and fatigue seem to make tinnitus worse.

-Quiet rooms can cause tinnitus to seem more distracting. Background noise may reduce the amount of noise you hear. Play music or white noise when you are trying to fall asleep or anytime you find yourself in a quiet place. You may consider buying a machine that makes soothing sounds, such as ocean waves.

-Try the herbal supplement ginkgo biloba. Some studies suggest that it may help relieve tinnitus, but other studies do not show a benefit. Further studies are needed to determine the best dosage. That first answer had a lot of hints and yet not the one that I know works - and that is to drink more water.  Dehydration is the basic cause of tinnitus.  Start drinking the 8 glasses (that's about 2 quarts a day).  Coffee doesn't count, it's a diuretic and depletes your system of water.

Without enough water, you can't wash away the toxins from your body.  For me, it's the easy answer that works.","Avoid or reduce alcohol, caffeine, and smoking, as they worsen tinnitus. Limit aspirin and NSAIDs; exercise regularly to improve blood flow to the ear. Avoid prolonged neck positions during exercise. Use ear protection in noisy environments; distract attention away from the noise. Practice relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga to manage stress, which can worsen tinnitus.

Oh no. Please keep smoking. More lung cancer patients are good for my hospital. The answer is ""yeh you are being affected adversely""

It may take time to build into a heart or lung condition - but it probably will do that. 

I assume you are an early smoker, with that, you are building a dependence that will make it very difficult to let go of the habit, even when you want to.  I've seen people already diagnosed with heart or lung disease who continued to smoke because the addiction was too strong for them to break.  

Not only are you damaging cells inside your body, but you are damaging your skin.  The most wrinkled people are the ones who have smoked over the years.  You can see  how the smoke constantly building would affect the skin.  Wrinkles around the lips and in the soft tissue under the eyes are the most prevalent in smokers.  Smoking takes the vitamins right out of your body, and can cause the bones and teeth to become weaker.

So, now you see you are damaging your heart & your lungs. Your respiratory system cancels out your breathing.  Cancer is prevalent in throat, tongue, lips, your bones and teeth are unhealthy - and finally, it's gotten to your skin too. 

If that doesn't make you stop - Let me remind you that you are also damaging anyone who happens to be in the room with you while you are smoking.  Second hand smoke has been proven to be as damaging as first hand.

Quit smoking and people will want to be with you more often.  Not only that you will smell better, breathe better and certainly like yourself better.

Plus you will save a lot of money as another side benefit.

Good luck.  Hope you'll give it your best shot.  Never quit quitting. Denial is a wonderfully easy was of saying you're not affected.  It's kind of like a 'James Dean' attitude, like ""it won't happen to me.""  Well, you can be SURE that every time you smoke, damage is being done.  It's kind of like a teenager saying ""we only had sex once."" (and she's pregnant) If this doesn't wake you up, then how about the knowledge that there are many intelligent people out there that have done many tests that will totally disagree with what you just said.

Nevertheless, you should contact a Physician/Gynecologist in your area in regards to this issue so that he/she can rule out the possibility of a tumor. Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) is actually only a symptom resulting from a glandular malfunction, a chronic disease, a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, and tumors, or more importantly, a neurosis precipitated by emotional distress (unhappy love affair, divorce, and the like). However, hormonal treatment is most frequently employed when the possibility of tumor has been ruled out; while neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help, but even in this case, hormonal theraphy can be very helpful.

Again, much depends on the underlying trouble; some cases can be completly cured, for others medical help is limited. I recommend visiting eMedicine's Patient Education Center for a list of other Self-Care at Home options as well http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp .

No
Chaney
Ashcroft
Rumsfelt
Bush mmmm...water and lettuce!! A diet without carbohydrates.  A no carb diet is probably a bad idea, but low-carb diets have been very popular in recent years.

As with any diet, it works best if you eat sensible portions and exercise. Low carb diets are based on the premise that a diet very low in carbohydrate leads to a reduction in the body's insulin production, resulting in fat and protein (muscle) stores being used as its main energy source Foolishness. Carbs are not necesarily bad for you unless you get the type that is. You must look up waht not eat or ask your doctor, or a nutritionist. Low carb diet” (also called “reduced carbohydrate” or “controlled carbohydrate”) is a broad term, encompassing many popular diet books (examples: Atkins, South Beach, Zone, Protein Power, Sugar Busters, Carbohydrate Addicts Diet) as well as eating plans that don’t follow a rigid format, but advise limiting the consumption of foods with a lot of carbohydrate. Some diets limit the amount of overall carbohydrate, while others focus on certain types of foods, generally ones high in starch and sugars, such as the “No White Foods” approach. Still others focus on how glycemic the diet is.

It’s important not to equate “low carb” with the very low carb phase of some popular diets. These phases are usually meant to be quite short, with more carbohydrate phased in after that. Other diets begin at a higher level of carbohydrate, but still less than the USDA Food Pyramid suggests. Any diet whose primary focus is the reduction of carbohydrate in any way is what is meant by “low carb” on this site. In terms of percentages, since the usual “mainstream” recommendation is a diet with 50-65% calories from carbohydrate, I consider a diet with 40% or less energy from carbs a “low-carb diet”, though most of them don’t measure it in this way. The natives in Alaska, I think their called the Inuit, live off of only meat which has no carbs. Though this diet doesn't seem to fair well with most others accustomed to a eurasian diet. And you can get scurvy if you cook the meat, strangley enough. The meat tends to lose their vitamins when cooked.","For information purposes, a diet without carbohydrates, commonly known as a no-carb diet, is explored in the text. While acknowledging the popularity of low-carb diets in recent years, it cautions against the potential pitfalls of completely eliminating carbohydrates. The importance of maintaining sensible portions and incorporating exercise into any diet is highlighted. Carbohydrates are defined as sugars or foods that convert into sugar in the body, with examples ranging from pasta and potatoes to cookies and bread. The text discusses the Atkins diet, a notable no-carb approach, recognizing its effectiveness in initial weight loss but noting the challenges of long-term adherence. It further delves into the broader category of low-carb diets, encompassing various popular plans and approaches, and emphasizes the distinction between short-term very low carb phases and more sustainable reduced carbohydrate diets.

Fatigue is different from drowsiness. In general, drowsiness is feeling the need to sleep, while fatigue is a lack of energy and motivation. Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of indifference or not caring about what happens) can be symptoms of fatigue.

Fatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked.

The pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if you wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, you may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid. On the other hand, if you wake up with a low level of energy and have fatigue that lasts throughout the day, you may be depressed.
========================

Do you have any underlying illnesses? Is your thyroid funcioning correctly? Are you sleeping soundly? Each of these can lead to fatigue. Have your doctor do some tests for thyroid function and ask your mate if you snore, if so, have a sleep study done. If you have an illness, don't take the vitamins without your doctor knowing what you are taking. (For instance, Warafin+Vit.K= trouble.)

Your work place can be making you sick too. Check the info on the webmd link below to see if that is the problem. 

There are so many reasons to be tired its hard to answer your question. The best way I think is to say what is ""not"" causing the lethargy and you will be led to what is causing it.

Good Luck~

How does a Sonicare toothbrush charge with no metal connection points?,"You are on the right track. It relies on inductive charging:
<quote>
If you own an electric toothbrush, there's a good chance that it has a completely sealed toothbrush unit. The toothbrush rests on the charger without any metal contacts to connect the toothbrush to the base. This has the great advantage of allowing the toothbrush to be completely sealed so that water cannot enter through exposed contacts. It also avoids any problems with water getting into the contacts and shorting out the charger.

This sort of sealed arrangement is called inductive charging. Essentially, the toothbrush and the base form a two-part transformer, with the base having one part of the transformer and the toothbrush having the other. When you slide the toothbrush onto the base, the complete transformer is created and charge can flow.

The base contains one of the coils and the metal bar. The toothbrush contains the second coil. When you drop the toothbrush onto the base, you create the complete transformer!

Would you categorize Bulimia Nervosa with Heroin addiction?  Why?,"I'm with Scorpio on this one.  Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).

What matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.

Addicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.

Today, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.

Best,

`k. I happen to agree with your friend. I've had my share of both bulimia and other addictions, and I classify all of them as ""coping mechanisms"" and ""distraction tools"". The only obvious difference between Bulimia Nervosa and a Heroin addiction is the physical addiction related to Heroin. The psychological factors are the same, it's simply a way to cope.","For information purposes, addiction is described as a compulsive dependence on substances or behaviors that are psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The central element of addiction lies in the uncontrollable, compulsive craving, seeking, and use of the substance or behavior, even when faced with adverse health and social consequences. Contrary to the misconception that addicts can quit through sheer willpower. Addiction is an illness necessitating biomedical treatment due to alterations in the brain caused by substance or behavioral abuse. Scientists and physicians agree that while individuals may exert control over use and abuse, addiction presents a distinct challenge, often prompting individuals to sacrifice important aspects of their lives in the pursuit of satisfying their addiction.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
can kissing cause HIV  infection ?,"Not dry kissing but wet kissing. NO!  HIV is not transferable through saliva.  HIV is only transferable through blood and sexual intercourse. no Nope, only exchange in blood and/or semen. Not unless your mate has it. But it starts out with AIDS wich is bad but not so bad and then turns into HIV which is terrible. Theoretically yes. The probability of it happening through this method are very low, but still plausible nonetheless. I tend to believe the Centers for Disease Control. It is this and other public misconceptions of the HIV virus that seems to be allowing it to propagate rapidly throughout the world. We need to educate ourselves on this epidemic before it is too late. Only if you have open sores in or around your mouth will you be subject to the virus, but no you can't contract the HIV virus from saliva. absolutely not I know several people who are HIV+, and the odds in catching HIV from kissing are far the than winning the lottery--when you actually need the money. the most likely way for you to catch it by kissing is if both people have cuts in their mouths. even still, with combination therapy (that is, if they are on [or have taken] meds), this occurence most likely WILL NOT HAPPEN.  however, if it goes past making out, then you gotta be careful. One more thing, while kissing an HIV+ person may be safe, you may want to watch out for anyone who may have MONO or HERPES. Causes of HIV/AIDS 
Cause of HIV/AIDS: AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick. 1 

Cause statistics for HIV/AIDS: The following are statistics from various sources about the causes of HIV/AIDS: 

57.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through sex with other men in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
24% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
9.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
38% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
59% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 
Cause details for HIV/AIDS: HIV disease is characterized by a gradual deterioration of immune function. Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called ""T-helper cells,"" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. 

A healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. 

Most scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS.

I'm looking for advice on gout pain. I do not want to take a prescription. Anything to use to stop reocurrance,"Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). Hyperuricemia usually does no harm, and most people with high levels of uric acid in the blood never develop gout. When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, uric acid may form crystals that accumulate in the joints. The exact cause of hyperuricemia sometimes goes undiscovered, although inherited factors (genes) seem to play a role. Gout can seem to flare up without specific cause or can be brought on by factors such as being overweight, eating meats and seafood that are high in chemicals called purines, taking certain medications (especially aspirin and diuretics), and drinking too much alcohol.

My own father and aunt have suffered with gout.  This is often a forerunner to diabetes. Here are a few things you can do to prevent an ""attack"" of gout.

1)Ease up on red meat. NEVER eat rare meat.  Purines are contained in  Beef,Pork,Lamb,Seafood,
Yeast (used in beer and bread),Alcoholic beverages, particularly beer,and Bacon.

2) Drink lots of water.  If you were drinking enough water your kidneys would filter the uric acid.

3) Drink low fat milk. This will help ""eat"" the uric acid from your blood.

Is there a way to SAFELY have sex with a new partner without spreading genital warts to them?,"HPV can be spread even without a condom.  Unfortunately there is no way to protect yourself 100% from HPV, although the risk is reduced if a condom is used.  HPV can be active in the skin, even though there are no warts present.  This means that you (or your partner) can have the virus and not even know it.  It stands to reason then, that HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.  My family doctor told me to just assume that everyone who has had more than 2 sexual partners in his/her lifetime has it.

UPDATE: Based on later answers, I wanted to address mutual m*sterbation.  You CAN get HPV from mutual mast.  HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye.  If you touch your partner's genitals and then touch your own with the same hand, you have most likely just put the HPV virus on your own skin.  Whether or not you will develop warts/lesions is unpredictable.  Some people have HPV but never show any lesions. Wearing a condom helps, but nothing is 100% safe.

what's bird flu?,"Avian influenza (also known as bird flu, avian flu, influenzavirus A flu, type A flu, or genus A flu) is a flu due to a type of influenza virus that is hosted by birds, but may infect several species of mammals. It was first identified in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]

The avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3. Bird Flu 
Hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the ""bird flu."" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.

The only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia.","For information purposes, avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is caused by influenza viruses hosted by birds but capable of infecting various mammal species.

what are the main clinical features of gilbert syndrome?,"Gilbert's syndrome: The only significant abnormality is mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is important clinically only because this disorder is often misdiagnosed as chronic hepatitis. The disorder, presumably lifelong, may affect as many as 3 to 5% of the population and is most often detected serendipitously in young adults with unrelated nonspecific complaints. Some family members may be affected, but a clear genetic pattern is often difficult to establish.

The pathogenesis is uncertain. There appear to be complex defects in the liver's uptake of plasma bilirubin, which usually fluctuates between 2 and 5 mg/dL (34 and 86 µmol/L) and tends to increase with fasting and other stresses. In addition, glucuronyl transferase activity is low; therefore, the disorder may be related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Many patients also have mildly diminished RBC survival, but this is insufficient to explain the hyperbilirubinemia.

Gilbert's syndrome can be easily differentiated from hepatitis by normal liver function tests, absence of urinary bile, and predominantly unconjugated bilirubin fractionation. Hemolysis is differentiated by the absence of anemia or reticulocytosis. Liver histology is normal, but biopsy is not needed for diagnosis. Patients should be reassured that they do not have liver disease. According to WebMD.com, Gilbert Syndrome is ""one of a benign (harmless) group of metabolic abnormalities, Gilbert Syndrome is a hereditary disorder leading to a defect in the clearance (removal) of bile pigment (bilirubin) from the liver. This syndrome is common but innocuous and easily controllable.""","For information purposes, gilbert Syndrome is a common, benign disorder affecting 3 to 5% of the population. It's often discovered incidentally in young adults with vague complaints. Though its exact cause is unclear, it involves liver uptake issues leading to elevated unconjugated bilirubin (2-5 mg/dL), exacerbated by fasting and stress. Patients typically have low glucuronyl transferase activity and slightly reduced red blood cell lifespan. Key differentiators from other conditions include normal liver function, absence of urinary bile, and unconjugated bilirubin predominance. Liver biopsy isn't necessary for diagnosis.

How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?,"I have not had a panic attack in four years.  Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me.  I sincerely hope this helps! you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you I would recommend Louise Hay's ""Self-Esteem Affirmations"" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway"" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches you to repeat ""I'll Handle It"", which is very helpful during a panic attack.

I have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me. meditate Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.

In the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web. I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called ""Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry"" that outlines various strategies.

First, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.

Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.

Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.

Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over ""Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon."" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).

Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.

Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? 

People do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!","If you experience repetitive and frequent panic attacks, consulting a mental health professional is advisable, and caution is urged with benzodiazepines due to potential habituation.

Is there a life insurance for people with cancer.?,"Depends on the type of cancer and how far along the treatments are.  The best bet is to contact a local life agent and give them all the information. Don't try to hide anything because it could result in a denial of payout down the road.

Like 20 grand if the person dies.  But, if they die in less then 2 years,  I think its only like 2000 plus how much you paid per month for every month that you paid.  So, if you paid 25 a month for 6 months, and the person dies, they give you only 2000 plus 150.  But if you can buy 4 or 5 of these, you can find 10 grand to bury this person.

why do i have headaches everyday?,"If your Doctor said that it is not migrains then it is probably tension headaches.  This is cause by contraction of some of the back muscles related to stress such as Trapezius, semispinalis capitits, splenious capitis etc.. Basically this tension that most probably is triggered by some sort of stress puts pressure on a spinal nerve coming out of the spinal cord that inhibits the optimum potential of your body to function properly.. Chiropractic uses a non invasive procedure to remove that nerve interference and permit the body to function in harmony without obstruction.. Chiropractic is proven and documented by peer reviewed journals to be effective with patients that have headaches.. What you don't want to do is rely on medication because your body will adapt to the chemicals and you'll always have to take them to feel normal.. Don't forget about the side effects that all medications have especially to the liver!!!! Get your spine checked and the headaches will go away.. Because alll girls are always in pain.   I learned this when i began dating.  Girls always are going through some sort of pain. I have headaches every day too. I have sinus, allergies,lots of stress,and bad eyes.

Is there a natural cure for menstrual cramps?,"the only cure i know is menopause; but i'm a guy, i dont know squat about women. People have been unable to identify a single cause of PMS. Theories range from hormonal and chemical to nutritional and psychological. Women whose mother or sisters have PMS are more likely to have it, so there may be a genetic component. A combination of genetic, physiological, and environmental causes are likely. Making dietary adjustments starting about 14 days before a period may help some women with certain mild menstrual disorders, such as cramping.

Why do I have body odor that won't go away?,"It's the food you're eating!!!

Try eating more greens and fish.

To get more greens, you can eat vegtables, go to Jamba Juice and take shots of Wheatgrass, or buy chloriphorm in a pill. . . I really suggest just eating more vegtables.

BMI is Used Differently with Children Than it is With Adults
In children and teens, body mass index is used to assess underweight, overweight, and risk for overweight. Children's body fatness changes over the years as they grow. Also, girls and boys differ in their body fatness as they mature. This is why BMI for children, also referred to as BMI-for-age, is gender and age specific.1, 2 BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth charts. These charts are used for children and teens 2 – 20 years of age. For the 2000 CDC Growth Charts and Additional Information visit CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.

Each of the CDC BMI-for-age gender specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating specific percentiles. Healthcare professionals use the following established percentile cutoff points to identify underweight and overweight in children.

http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi-for-age.htm Well first off you really can't go by the charts tey use now because they are really outdated. So i wouldn't suggest using some kind of ""average weight"" to determine that. And you have to think about a lot of different factors. Ethnicity is one. Some ethnicities tend to be heavier than others. She may also have big bones (tho some people think that's a cop-out). And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her. But since she's twelve she's still growing so it may balance out for her.","Body mass index (BMI) is utilized differently in children than in adults.

what is nuclear medicine?,"Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.

Nuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.

Nuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.

If your baby's eyes seem to point in different directions or not focus on the same object, he may have strabismus — a lack of coordination between the eyes. They may appear to be ""crossed"" or one may seem to drift inward, outward, or upward. Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then).

What is amblyopia?
Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye. This can happen if your baby's eyes are misaligned or if he can't see as well with one eye because of nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or something that's blocking clear vision in that eye, like a cataract or a drooping eyelid.

About 3 to 6 percent of children under the age of 6 develop amblyopia. Treatment is most successful before age 5 or 6, although recent research shows that even older children may recover their vision. If ignored, though, amblyopia can result in permanent vision loss. This sounds like a vestibular problem to me.  The nerves in your ears that help you with balance also have connections to the muscles that move your eyes.

does drinking a lot of water kill your appetite? how often should i drink it?,"No. It doesn't.

Though no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help you estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.

Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:

Excessive thirst 
Fatigue 
Headache 
Dry mouth 
Little or no urination 
Muscle weakness 
Dizziness 
Lightheadedness 

Every day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?

This isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and ""out of habit."" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.

Replacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. 
Eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the ""8 x 8 rule"" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, ""drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,"" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. 
Dietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. I have to disagree with most of the people I guess. Drinking cold water does suppress appetite because it sits in your stomach longer and makes you feel fuller. Your stomach has to heat it up before your body can process it, so it can trick your stomach into curbing the urge for munchies. No, it doesn't kill your appetite. Depending on the climate in which you live you should drink 8 or more cups of water a day. you shud drink about half a gallon of water a day","For information purposes, the lack of water in the body can lead to dehydration, even with a mild loss of 1 percent to 2 percent of body weight, causing fatigue and diminished energy. Dehydration is especially risky for the very young and the elderly. Symptoms include excessive thirst, headache, dry mouth, little or no urination, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness. Daily water loss occurs through various means like sweating, exhaling, urination, and bowel movements. To maintain proper bodily function, it's essential to replace lost fluids by consuming water-containing beverages and foods. While there's no universal recommendation for daily fluid intake, common approaches include the replacement approach, which suggests consuming at least 8 cups (2 liters) of water a day, and dietary recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, suggesting about 13 cups for men and 9 cups for women.

What's the root cause of insomnia?,"There isn't going to be one root cause of insomnia.  It can be caused by psychological issues such as stress or anxiety as noted above.  Chemical stimulants such as caffeine and pseudoephedrine (sudafed) can cause it. It may result from imbalances in body chemistry (many women experience insomnia as part of PMS). Physical activity or stimulation late in the evening can make it hard to sleep.  Physiological problems that cause pain will interfere with sleep, as well as sleep apnea.

I'm not even sure this is a definitive list. STRESS .... STRESS and more stress ... an active mind is actually a good thing to waste ....

I believe that marijuana usage can dangerously impair someone who is driving and should have the same restrictions that we currently have for alcoholic beverages.
   By the way, I would never be in favor of legalizing drugs like cocaine, heroine, crystal methamphetamine or ecstasy unless they could be proven to have a medical benefit and be used under the supervision of physicians. No , because mostly who begins with Cannabis ; finish with Cocain . The problem lies within the governing of it. How does uncle Sam get a piece of the action? If it were to be legalized, people would grow it at home or in hiding like they do now. Who would buy it for a high taxed price when they can get it cheaper on the street? Absolutely!!!  No one has ever died using cannabis.  It has MANY medicinal benefits.  But we must hold a person accountable for his actions, even under the influence of cannabis.

But this is advanced bio-tech you're talking about and so far we've only begun to look through those sort of progress lines. My answer if you're thinking it for yourself with all the money that you have - is IT CAN'T BE DONE - sorry, mate.

But I can advise you on one hint to avoid nightmares. DO NOT sleep with your hand(s) on your heart - even accidentally! You're sure to be troubled if you try it out even for fun. Usually there is a reason for repetitive nightmares, something that you dread or that has happened to you. If you find out what that is and work it out (see a counselor), you can work against nightmares. If you only ocasionally have nightmares, it does not make such a difference in your sleep that it could affect your health.","In theory, shutting off nightmares through advanced bio-tech is not currently possible.

I eat next to no fruits or vegetables.

You could be prone to diseases because of acidity or lack of vitamins - possibly something like scurvy.  

Just a few suggestions (hoping you don't mind):

- take some vitamin & mineral supplements daily if you really hate fruits & vegtables. You especially need to take in more vitamin C since you aren't getting it from fruit & vegetables.

Try to at least get some of these in....

- Try smoothies with frozen fruit & juice. You can also add  milk or yogurt to make it creamy. Add some honey if you have to. Mix with a hand blender. You can also buy instant ones now.

- There are some pretty yummy frozen vegetables with sauce out there that are fast.   

- Keep fruit around as a snack or buy canned fruit salad. You can also try dried fruit.

- Keep pre-packaged mini carrots and celery with dipping sauce handy. 

- If you really hate the taste of vegetables...then add many herbs or strong tasting sauce to disguise the taste.

Sorry to sound like a mom! Please see a doctor or nutritionist. Take care of yourself. In my opinion, eating no fruits or vegetables (highly alkalinic foods) *on a PH scale*, youre most likely keeping your body's PH acidic, thus making it easyly suceptible to various diseases...

If you walk into school tomorrow and instead of complaining about your braces or trying to hide them, just smile and talk with your friends and don't worry about them.  You will be surprised that most people will not even notice them.  And even if they do, enough other people have braces, they will get used to your slightly changed appearance in a couple of days.

However, what they can do is tax these unhealthy things (like high taxes on tobacco and alcohol in most countries, high taxes on gas in Europe, etc.). lots of things are legal, even though they are harmful ,alchohol,cigarrets,even watching television. its not up to the government to decide what’s healthy for an each person. though they make life tough by taxes and laws(most Muslim countries ban alcohol as its against their religion, Singapore has high taxes on cigarretes)its up to you to decide .

Is it dangerous to get in a tanning bed while your pregnant?,"While there is no evidence that a fetus is affected by its mothers' exposure to either the natural sun or indoor tanning equipment, a potential drawback to tanning during pregnancy may be the risk of the woman's body overheating. Pregnant women are cautioned to avoid prolonged sauna and whirlpool exposure due to the possible harm to the fetus from the rise in the woman's core body temperature. Core body temperature is the temperature of the blood as it is pumped from the heart, which normally ranges from 99 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Extended periods of sauna or whirlpool exposures or prolonged vigorous exercise may actually cause this temperature to rise.

I'm trying to shed a couple of lbs. Any tips not involving major diets?,"eat 4-6 small meals every day instead of 2 or 3 large ones - pay attention to portion sizes when you do this... eat a variety of proteins, carbs, fruits, and veggies, and drink tons of water! Dehydrated fat cells stick together causing them to stick to you! When you drink water, it hydrates the fat cells and makes them separate so they can be flushed out... If you do nothing else in the area of exercise - walk for 30 minutes a day. Even if you have to separate it into time blocks, every step you take is another step you hadn't taken before. 

*If you have a salty-tooth but don't want to eat anything really heavy - try popcorn with limited salt/butter.

*For a sweet-tooth that can't be appeased by fruits, eat cotton candy... even though it's pure sugar, you have to eat a TON of it for the calories to really add up :) Google your ideal caloric intake based on your age, height, and weight. There are 3500 calories in a pound. And let's say for example you need 2000 calories per day. If you cut back to 1500, then you would lose 1lb per week. If you exercise, and burn an additional 300 calories per day, then you would lose almost 2lbs per week. Forget all the fad diets. This works! I promise! This may sound trite, but look at the Food Guide Pyramid.  Eat from all of the food groups listed, including the recommended daily allowance of each.  I think serving sizes is the key!  How many slices of  pizza constitutes a serving size?  Do we really only eat one cup of cereal in the morning?  How often do we really eat 5 or more servings of veggies every day?

Calcium plays a big part in metabolism and weight loss, so drink your milk!  Also, be sure to drink the appropriate amount of water each day.  It flushes out body wastes and toxins, and helps to control ""water weight."" Eat smaller portions, exercise more.
burn more calories than your intake. try to start your day with a food that give you energy to help you cleanse  without using a lot of energy to digest
the best food is fresh squeezed fruit or vegetables
used your own juicer with fresh fruit or vegetable
and drink alot of water

eat salad before lunch and dinner
make you feel full without eating too much

and good combination
don't mix youf protein with carb
for example
if you eat meat try eat with vegetable
if you want  potato( not fried) try with vegetable

pasta bread is a bad source of carb cos its mixes between carb and protein
bread contain flour and milk and egg 
pasta has egg and flour
good source of carb is rice, potatoed
and peas is also a protein not a just a vegetable

that is why the speak alot about whole grain 
but if you still eating your whole grain as a form of  bagel , muffin and bread or pasta
you may aswell  eat you hamburger

be better to eat raw vegetabables than steam
cut down your fried food or grill
be better if it steam for meat 
and  eat fruit 30 min before you eat your food 
other wise you don't have a good benefit out of fruit

if you do this for 2 week at least 
you will feel better and healtier

I've had my first period when I was 15 and have never had it since then. Is there an alternative to the pill?,"I used to get the Depo Provera shot, which is almost the same as the pill.

I recently started again a few years ago and have been off of it for a little over a year and my period still isn't regular. My OB/GYN said that it can take up to 2 years for your body to rid itself of the birth control (whether it be the pill or the shot) and go back to normal. Just be patient. It'll balance out eventually. Early menopause is often an over looked cause. Birth control pills, also causes frequent missed periods.

Nevertheless, you should contact a Physician/Gynecologist in your area in regards to this issue so that he/she can rule out the possibility of a tumor. Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) is actually only a symptom resulting from a glandular malfunction, a chronic disease, a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, and tumors, or more importantly, a neurosis precipitated by emotional distress (unhappy love affair, divorce, and the like). However, hormonal treatment is most frequently employed when the possibility of tumor has been ruled out; while neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help, but even in this case, hormonal theraphy can be very helpful.

I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.  So, if you do exactly what I say, not only will you have a chance to survive, but all your friends that may get cancer... without any responsibility, or liability, on my part , you have to enhance your imune system to fight the cancer once and for all, and improver the blood circulation in the capiliries. 
to that you have to drink as much as you can of the following;.

2/3 (two thirds ) pommegranate juice, (best fresh or frozen)
1/3 orange juice

a little bit of persian lime juice (mexican lime)  will do.

try it now and let me know, it should have immediate effect.","For cancer, it is recommended to visit a specific website and explore the use of cesium chloride and oxygen drops. These websites offer comprehensive packages for purchase, and the suggested treatment duration may vary, lasting for three months, a year, or as prescribed.

what is an aflatoxin?,"PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI


Reddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as ""Turkey 'X' Disease"" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.

Natural occurrence:

Food products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. 

Physical and chemical properties:

Aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide. if you live in the united states, who cares?  THis is a disese of 3rd world countries where wheat and other such products spoil and have a fungus in them which produces toxins which promote the formation of liver cancer.  Not a problem in this country. af·la·tox·in (fl-tksn)n.

I was once in a emotional abusive relationship but got out of it because it wasn't love I was always sad and he was always bringing me down. My best advice to you is to follow your heart, if it say's that you don't love him then leave because you will never be truly happy with someone that has done you wrong in the past and you don't love any more.

I recently found a lump in my breast.?,"You have not mentioned your age. Better consult your doctor. It requires further investigations. If you are truly concerned, consider getting a second opinion from a doctor of your own choosing, NOT one that's been recommended by the doc that gave you the first reading.  That way you know there are no conflicting interests.

Sometimes a lump is just a lump.  Breasts get lumpy during certain times of the month, and goes along with normal cycles.  Calcifications and shadowing are pretty routine findings as well.  If there was something to be concerned about, the first doc would have ordered a biopsy on the lump.  A biopsy is where a needle is inserted into the lump and a sample is taken to be studied, to determine whether it is cancerous. This same time last year I was experiencing the same thing.  No one was ever really sure what the lump was but it wasn't cancerous.  I even had a biopsy after the ultrasound and mammogram showed nothing.  Perhaps your doctor will schedule one for you.  And if nothing still shows up they will schedule you for another ultrasound in six months.
I've had my six month check up, and I'm happy to say IT'S STILL NOTHING!!
I wish you the best.
Be blessed!! My best friend has calcifictions. Has had them for years. She is fine. I have had 3 lumps. All were nothing. 99% of breast ""abnormalities"" (actually not that abnormal) are NOT CANCER. If you have been screened, and still feel concerned, get a second opinion. #1 thing, don't worry. Worry causes more cancer than breast lumps do.

Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"the depo shot has many side effects. the weight gain is due to certain hormones in the shot and as long as you are on the shot you will continue to gain weight. i personally do not recommend the shot due to many factors including the weight gain, spotting, and not to mention, when you are ready to have children and get off the shot, you will not be able to concieve for 12 to 18 months. my recommendation is to go of the shot. if long term birth control is what you want, you should go with the iud, it is more effective, when inserted it can last for up to 5 years, and it doesn't have the weight gaining side effect. genetics I had a friend that gained like 35 pounds and had spotting for 4 months straight, she was miserable--poor thing. That's why I never went on it--too many side effects!! After having my son, I went back down to right around my original weight.  I was then on Depo for 3 years, and in that time gained about 44 pounds.  The woman at the clinic told me that the weight would just start falling off after quitting the depo, however, it didn't.  I have been taking a prescription weight loss drug called phentermine, which works great, but isn't permanent.  The only thing my doctor can come up with is that my metabolism is changing with my age (I'm only 21).

Fatigue and exhaustion are your body’s way of telling you that enough is enough! It means that the energy stores in your body have been depleted—often by stress, worry, and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Unfortunately, most of us combat this fatigue with “artificial” energy products (stimulants) that give a temporary boost but leave us more exhausted afterwards.

Fatigue is the feeling of extreme tiredness or loss of energy due to physical strain, mental strain, or illness. Typically, fatigue is easily remedied through additional rest and relaxation. However, extreme or chronic fatigue is a more serious form of fatigue that can be caused by one of a number of diseases. Among these fatigue-causing illnesses are chronic fatique syndrome, diabetes, depression, and more. If you always feel tired and suspect some abnormal underlying cause, consider seeing a doctor when convenient.

General fatigue can affect your daily life as well as those people who surround you and should be taken seriously. Difficulty getting restful sleep or constant fatigue during the day can be helped with natural remedies in addition to certain medications. Fatigue medications should be prescribed by a trained health care practitioner. Herbal medicines, natural therapies, and other alternative means can be explored more freely, but not all remedies are guaranteed to work for every person. Certain anti-fatigue products will help you be more alert and in tune with your surroundings. Find ways to help treat your fatigue right away

Possible Causes of Fatigue
Though little is known about fatigue prevention and treatment, fatigue may be related to a variety of medical and physical conditions and psychosocial factors. Fatigue can be caused by anemia or associated with major organ dysfunction, including severe heart or lung disease, kidney failure, or liver failure. Hypothyroidism (insufficient production of thyroid hormone) and adrenal problems, even if mild, can cause fatigue. Neuromuscular disorders, malnutrition, infection, dehydration or electrolyte disturbances can also be associated with fatigue, as well as sleep disorders, immobility and lack of exercise, chronic pain, or the use of centrally-acting drugs (e.g., opioids). Psychosocial factors associated with fatigue are anxiety and depression, stress, and those related to the reactions of others to the fatigue. Drink LOTS of water.  Dehydration is currently the cause of most fatigue like symptoms. a glass of warm milk and sleep.",It is suggested to see a doctor and drink a lot of water to heal fatigue.,suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"
how fast can i see results from doing sit ups?,"First, you should stick with crunches..they are less stressful on your back and focus more on the correct muscles. Then, if you cut out all fat from your diet and limit your caloric intake, you will see results in 3 - 4 weeks. That is, if you are doing a serious ab routinue of at least 25 minutes/day (with 1 day off a week).
If you have a not-so-healthy eating lifestyle, doing sit ups will not help and you will most likely not see any results unless you are doing a complete ab workout (obliques, crunches, roman chair, scissors, leg lifts, etc.) for at least 2 hours/day. 
The best way is to cut fat (soda, junk food are the easiest) and gradually build into a harder and harder workout where you start at 3 sets of 30 sit ups for a week and add one set and 10 reps per set every week. In ten weeks, you will have a solid workout that will produce very good results. With every workout routine, you should be doing a cardio-vascular exercise (running, biking, brisk walking) to burn calories. And always consult a doctor for the proper workout schedule for your age and body type. It really depends on your diet.  If you are burning more calories during the day than you consume, you will lose weight (to a point), and eventually see abdominal definition.  Genetics also play a significant role on how hard you will have to work (look at family members).  It also depends on how good a shape you're already in, and what other exercises you're doing.  For example, if you have a huge chest, the sheer circumference difference will make your waist look smaller.","To sculpt your abs effectively, prioritize crunches over sit-ups as they are gentler on the back and target the muscles more precisely. Combine this with a dietary approach focused on cutting out fat and reducing caloric intake. Significant results can be visible in 3-4 weeks, especially when complemented by a dedicated ab routine lasting at least 25 minutes a day, with one day off per week. For those with an unhealthy eating lifestyle, a comprehensive ab workout involving obliques, crunches, roman chair exercises, scissors, leg lifts, etc., for at least 2 hours a day is recommended. Gradually intensify the workout, starting with 3 sets of 30 sit-ups per week and adding one set and 10 reps per set weekly over ten weeks.

with Love sounds like you have a bad cold. buy some off the counter sinus and allergy pills at Wal-mart. their brand works just as well.make sure it contains anthihistamine that works for the sore throat. studies have shown that liquid cough medicine doesn't work that well. if you start to get a fever go to a County Hospital ER. they are supposed to help anyone its funded with our taxes.  GET WELL SOON. It sounds like allergies to me. If you are not restricted I would take a benadryl and see a low cost clinic.

How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.

Lowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.

However...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  

If you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing! They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though. If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  

I had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  

Eating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP. The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed. The surgery isn't as bad as you think it may be.","To eliminate gallstones without surgery, consider a low-fat diet, particularly low in saturated fats, as it may help reduce pain associated with gallbladder disease. Exploring holistic stores for organic remedies could offer natural alternatives, yet these might not eliminate existing stones.

Unfortunately nothing to cure cancer no,but there are better screening and diagnostic tests that can be done earlier and more effectively to extend the life of those afflicted.

Hopefully soon there will be a cure. Of course. Exspecially if you believe there is. no there is no medicine cure for cancer. surgery may help to remove certain cancer mass. chemotherapy is also a palliative treatment. Medicine is getting close to a breakthrough method for actually attacking several types of cancers without side effects.

"How can I do to remember a lot of information, I mean to improve memory?","Concentration issues stem from numerous things. Too much caffeine, being ADD, or vitamin deficiencies can all cause you to not perform at your best.

I recommend taking at the very least, one multivitamin a day to start. Also, regular exercise has proven to increase bloodflow to the brain which, in turn, increases memory retention. Finally there are a number of activities which help as well, I'll list a few here:

- Crossword puzzles are very good for maintaining mental health.
- Mental association exercises. You will need to get a book or do further research on this one. But there are mental tricks you can use to remember names, lists of objects, and so on. For instance, I use a name association to remember people's names. I think of some outstanding feature of a person when I meet them and integrate it (mentally) with their name. That and I repeat the name a few times in conversation. That is just one item though.
- There are also a new breed of drugs hitting the market. Do a search for ""smart drugs"" or nootropics.

Hepatitis A: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). Hepatitis A can affect anyone. In the United States, hepatitis A can occur in situations ranging from isolated cases of disease to widespread epidemics. 
 Hepatitis B: is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver. The virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. 
 Hepatitis C: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is found in the blood of persons who have the disease. HCV is spread by contact with the blood of an infected person.


 
 Hepatitis D: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a defective virus that needs the hepatitis B virus to exist. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is found in the blood of persons infected with the virus.

He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and refuses to take his medicine.  The dr will give him the prescription, but not make him take it.  Can you imagine living with him?  You wouldn't believe the crazy things he's accused me of, including putting the implant in.  Also, he did go to the dentist and had them cut his gums, but never gave them the real reason for doing it. I'm sure when he sees this, he'll be mad, but I had to get my say.  I wish he was only just saying this. Do you know what makes you believe you have an implant in your tooth and are being followed?  Is there any reason someone would be following you?  I mean do you have secret information or something important to someone else?

Believing you're being followed doesn't make you a Schizophrenic anyway....it might be indicative of being paranoid.  Lots of people experience some paranoia along the way.  It's particularly found in alcoholics and drug users....

I'd suggest you visit a therapist, psychiatrist, or psychologist and talk about those feelings to see if you can get beyond them.  It's not a nice way to live...always looking behind you.

Good luck. I suggest that you visit your dentist and have the tooth evaluated for your own mind.  Your wife has some reasons of concern.  Why are people following you?  Are you an important target for people to spend time following you?  After the dental visit, you should seek mental health evaluation for your feelings that people are following you.

It is not a normal feeling that you should have.  You should seek the professional help. I think you are normal, and you want us to think you're crazy...  for something to do.

Sex after baby?,"Just about every set of new parents go through this.
There is so much going on with your wife right now, and not just with taking care of the baby.  Her hormones are still trying to get back to normal, and her body is still recovering.  The whole hormone thing can really kick her butt.  She can be upset, and not have any idea why.
The best thing to do is take it slow, and give her time.  She is probably tired, and doesn't feel very sexy.  Also, if you are making sex an issue, it will tend to make things worse.
She needs you to be sweet to her, tell her much you appreciate her, tell her that she is a great mommy, and how proud you are of her.  Volunteer to do a chore that is normally hers.  Rub her feet, or give her a backrub without making it lead to anything else.  You will be very surprised how much this will work.  Remember that foreplay starts for the woman first thing in the morning. I'm not a guy but I can try and offer some advice. First of all make sure you are both keeping the communicatioin flowing between you. Do you help her with the baby? Do you try and take some of the load off of her so she can relax a little? 
Does the baby always sleep with you guys? Try and make sure that the baby is not always sleeping in the room. Maybe put the baby down a little early, draw a nice bath for her, let her relax a bit and then try to get the sparks going between you two. 
It is very important that your wife keep your relationship as husband and wife as a priority above the children. (That is in the bible)

Always reassure her that she is still very sexy to you, and don't make your compliments happen only when you are looking for sex. Do them all the time, without expecting recourse to your comment.

don't eat immediately before the drive, but make sure you have some food in you.  eat or drink some ginger (i like candied ginger).  if its nice out, crack the window a bit. if its cold, crack it every once in awhile, especially if you start to feel sick.  keep a bottle of water handy and take a sip from time to time.  other than that, keep your eyes forward, don't look out the sides.  and try to look at distant objects instead of up close ones.

works for me.  although i almost always got a little nauseas on the drive, i never vomited.  wish is could say the same for my dog. Before a one hour while going to long drive. I take vomit medicine and not too much eat. There is a tablet called avomine which helps you prevent vomiting. The most effective cure, is ginger pills.  These pills can be purchased as suppliments, ect, from the grocery.

Youc an also eat some raw ginger to help with this, but keep that in moderation, as it can be an irritant to your stomach as well.

My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble?,"Give it time. With an ear infection you usually have some fluid build up behind the eardrum. Even if the fever is gone, the fluid (and the bacteria in it)can still be there. So the hearing should improve as the fluid goes away and make sure your daughter finishes the full course of the Amoxicillin, or the bacteria in the fluid can start multiplying again and she can end up even sicker than before. I learned this the hard way. If she has had alot of ear infections, i would ask your doc to send her to a specialist.

what are the main clinical features of gilbert syndrome?,"Gilbert's syndrome: The only significant abnormality is mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is important clinically only because this disorder is often misdiagnosed as chronic hepatitis. The disorder, presumably lifelong, may affect as many as 3 to 5% of the population and is most often detected serendipitously in young adults with unrelated nonspecific complaints. Some family members may be affected, but a clear genetic pattern is often difficult to establish.

The pathogenesis is uncertain. There appear to be complex defects in the liver's uptake of plasma bilirubin, which usually fluctuates between 2 and 5 mg/dL (34 and 86 µmol/L) and tends to increase with fasting and other stresses. In addition, glucuronyl transferase activity is low; therefore, the disorder may be related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Many patients also have mildly diminished RBC survival, but this is insufficient to explain the hyperbilirubinemia.

Gilbert's syndrome can be easily differentiated from hepatitis by normal liver function tests, absence of urinary bile, and predominantly unconjugated bilirubin fractionation. Hemolysis is differentiated by the absence of anemia or reticulocytosis. Liver histology is normal, but biopsy is not needed for diagnosis. Patients should be reassured that they do not have liver disease. According to WebMD.com, Gilbert Syndrome is ""one of a benign (harmless) group of metabolic abnormalities, Gilbert Syndrome is a hereditary disorder leading to a defect in the clearance (removal) of bile pigment (bilirubin) from the liver. This syndrome is common but innocuous and easily controllable.""","Gilbert syndrome is characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, often misdiagnosed as chronic hepatitis.

Why do women who spend a lot of time together have their periods at the same time?,"A: Women (and men) secrete odorless molecules, called pheromones, in a manner as common as sweating. In fact, the sweat of many mammals contains pheromone chemicals. The molecules from one woman bounce and jiggle their way airborne and waft to another. Receptors in the nose detect the pheromones and the second woman responds by shortening or lengthening her menstrual period. Gradually, over the course of a few months, the periods of all the women living together synchronize in this way. It's called synchronious menstruation.  It's happened to me on two occasions.  Once at a camp where there were about 30 girls in a cabin, and I swear to you, every single one of us got our periods over a period of 10 days.  The second time was in college with my room mate and our suite mates.

- take some vitamin & mineral supplements daily if you really hate fruits & vegtables. You especially need to take in more vitamin C since you aren't getting it from fruit & vegetables.

- Try smoothies with frozen fruit & juice. You can also add  milk or yogurt to make it creamy. Add some honey if you have to. Mix with a hand blender. You can also buy instant ones now.

- There are some pretty yummy frozen vegetables with sauce out there that are fast.   

- Keep fruit around as a snack or buy canned fruit salad. You can also try dried fruit.

- Keep pre-packaged mini carrots and celery with dipping sauce handy.

How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.

Lowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.

However...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  

If you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing! They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though. If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  

I had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  

Eating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP. The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed.

How to prevent infant from influenza virus ?,"What is happening is that your baby does not have influenza.  What it has most likely is just a regular common cold caused by adenovirus or a rhinovirus.  No medicine will cure you of this.  ITs just time.  

Babies are obligate nasal breathers, and when they get a cold, and get stuffy, they have a bit more trouble, and make it seem worse than it is.  Suction that nose often, and you can use saline drops to help lossen some of the snot.  

To prevent the flu from the influenza virus - keep your baby away from sick people, wash your hands prior to touching the baby, and keep breast feeding. The best way to help prevent influenza infection is to get an influenza vaccination each year, usually in early November. Unfortunately, immunization (administration of vaccine) against influenza is approved only for infants 6 months of age and over.

Do I need a counselor...?,"It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves. I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS. If so, counseling is for you. If not, you could certainly consider going by yourself to work on strategies to deal with the stress and anxiety this causes you. I think counseling would be a great place to start, and also perhaps some family couseling.  Look through the phone book for family counselors.

Good luck to you. My first response to your question is YES, you should find a family counselor who will work with your family both as a unit and individually-

2.  Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.  Soda or alcohol before sleep is the WORST!

On the other hand, if it is infrequent, it may just be caused by some foods that you eat.

for lower abs, flat on back feet together, raise your feet appx 6 inches off the floor hold to 5 count spread legs (keep knees locked straight)hold to 5, feet back together and down slowly. that will be a one count now try to do 9 more. build your strength and number of reps.

what is the best way to cure dry skin?,"best stuff is jergens. I was once on hydrocortizone. if thats how you spell it. It didnt help, but jergens did. Use the one for extremely dry skin, the best they have. and use it every day. hydrocortizone is a medicine that doesnt cure you. it only keeps you on their medicine so that they can make more money off of you. Different things work for different people, but previous postings are good. Try a humidifier - I didn't used to like them, but there are many kinds to choose from now. Next, try the shorter, less frequent, less hot showers, using Dove creamy sensitive skin body wash, followed by Lubriderm sensitive skin lotion applied within 3 minutes of showering. Bag/udder balm also works for a lot of people... but even that may mean trying different brands. 

I had tried just about everything, and finally went to a dermatologist. Those recommendations (above) all helped.  Vaseline and other petroleum-based products feel great for a short time, but are ultimately drying. If you take hot showers you should either shorten the amount of timw you are in the shower or lower the temparature of your water. You just the amount of soap needed... using too much can dry your skin out, also use some kind of lotion or even that baby oil gel while your skin is still damp from the shower. For your feet use ""Udderly Smooth"" you cann find it in like Walmart and Walgreens and stuff... the bottle has cows print on it... that stuff works the best glycerine based soaps,shampoo or shower gel Run a humidifier in your home in the winter.  You wouldn't believe the difference this makes.  Winter air is dry, and it's even worse when you've got indoor heat running.  So keep the air in your home moist.

And then of course, a good moisturizer, like Neutrogena or Jergens helps a lot.  Use 3 times a day.   

But you really won't need as much active lotion care if you just keep the air less dry -- your skin will heal as you sleep in the healthier air in your home.  Sharper image has some good ionizing humidifiers.  I stopped needing lotion and chapstick altogether once I discovered this trick a few years ago. call your man, ask him, but tell him the truth Baby oil or vasileine vaseline or pure vitamin e oil whenever u get a chance smashed bananas and honey sounds gross but it works!!!!

Why do I keep losing weight but my waist will not go down any further?,"You need to target exercises on your abdominal muscles. In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.

The first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.

Fat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.

So if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. 

The most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). 
You have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. 

If you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: 
  
1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) 
  
1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) 
  
1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)
  
Your abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. 
  
Increase metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!

This means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! 

Here's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).
  
Warm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes 
  
Perform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) 
  
perform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) 
  
Repeat this process from 6-10 times 
  
Cool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  
  
Maintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!

To stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?

Give your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). 

Most people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! 

I'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don’t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st Depends, how are you losing this weight?","Achieving a trim waistline involves a comprehensive approach blending targeted strength training, cardiovascular exercises, and stable blood sugar maintenance. Fat, originating from excess calorie intake, overlays abdominal muscles, emphasizing the need for focused exercises. Incorporate a range of movements, including sit-ups, crunches, side bends, twists, and rotations, progressively intensifying sessions up to three times a week. Short and intense cardio, like interval training, boosts metabolism. Crucially, stabilize blood sugar levels by consuming balanced, frequent meals rich in fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins.

what is the best way to get rid of heart burn?,"I've had chronic heartburn, and though I'm not a doctor, I'm sharing with you advice my doctor has given me (and what has worked!)

1.  For immediate relief, use Maalox.  Avoid Pepto Bismol, as it has something that irritates the stomach long term (my gastroenterologist told me that!).  For longer term use, use Priolosec.

2.  Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.  Soda or alcohol before sleep is the WORST!

3.  Limit intake of:  Alcohol, Caffience, Carbonated beverages, spicy foods, acidic foods, aspirin (or advil, motrin).   Honestly, I can't stick to this one -- but I've been pretty good keeping #1 and #2, and it's kept my heart burn at bay.  Be good keeping 1 & 2 and you can cheat on 3 -- at least, that's worked for me.

Good luck! i drink milk and my heartburn goes away. i have never taken medicine for heartburn when i get it. If your heartburn is persistant and regular, I'd suggest seeing a Dr. You may suffer from acid reflux and there are many drugs on the market for it. I've found that prevacid is the ONLY one that works for me, but your Dr. may want you to try some of the least expensive ones first. On the other hand, if it is infrequent, it may just be caused by some foods that you eat.

why is it said that laughter is the best medicine?,"Because you are free from worries and your mind and body relaxes. It is the best medicine because it increases your heart rate and produces positive chemicals in your brain.

When you laugh even when you are sad, you will feel a sudden increase in your happiness. It's basically just having a good outlook on things and being optimistic that is good for your health. They come up with studies that do actually prove that people who laugh, or just otherwise have a good time in life, end up living longer than those who don't. It releases endorphines, suposedly, which make you feel good and happy. They say it's the best medicine because a good outlook helps you through disease and depression. Whoopdiedo.

I think I read somewhere that laughing for 30 minutes straight either makes your white blood cells produce 20% faster or you have 20% more.

"I have a soar throat and mouth ulcer now, it is there for a week now. Any natural way or home ideas?","I recently answered a similar question but only dealing with sore throat.  The best natural method I am familiar with is licorice.  A double clinical study of patients with nonspecific sore throat tested licorice tea (throat coat brand) and found a significant reduction in throat pain as compared with placebo in as little as 10 minutes.  Patients were told to consume this tea 4-6 times per day.

Licorice tea will probably also help with the pain of the mouth sore, even if it does not make the sore heal faster, but it might help with that too.

Licorice has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help with the blister.

One warning, though,  is that you should not consume too much licorice, especially if you have blood pressure problems.  A case report from the Netherlands reported that excessive consumption of licorice tea (about 3 liters per day, so a lot) can temproarily raise blood pressure.  This rise in blood pressure may drop back down after licorice tea stops being consumed, but it may take time.

"if i am breastfeeding, what should i do to lose weight?","The wonderful thing about breastfeeding is that it burns an extra 300-500 calories a day! I was back down to 125lbs at 4 months after my baby was born and he was exclusively breastfed. You are able to do any exercise that is comfortable for your postpartum body. The only thing that is probably not okay are weight loss pills or supplements as they could pass through your milk to the baby; I would recommend checking them with a lactation consultant before using them. While breastfeeding, losing weight CAN be more difficult.  Most women find that they do not lose all of their ""baby"" weight until they wean (unless, like me, you had plenty of extra weight before the baby, and your body isn't all that concerned about if that pound is a ""baby"" pound or a ""too many chocolate donuts"" pound!).  However, weight loss during breastfeeding is possible (living proof!).  The best way to go is to reduce the number of calories you eat and increase your exercise (I know, it's not as fun as taking a diet pill, but it lasts longer!).  While breastfeeding, your body uses about 500 calories a day to make milk for baby.  The most important thing for you is to make sure the foods you are eating are 80-90 % healthy (like during pregnancy).  If you eat junk, your baby will still get good milk, but your body will suffer because you will not get the vitamens and minerals you need.  As far as exercise goes, if you haven't been exercising, start slowly.  And remember, it took 9 months to put the weight on -- it will likely take 9 months to take it off.","Breastfeeding offers the advantage of burning an extra 300-500 calories daily, but certain precautions should be taken. While engaging in any comfortable postpartum exercise is generally acceptable, weight loss pills or supplements may pose risks as they could pass through breast milk to the baby. Although losing weight during breastfeeding can be challenging, it is possible through a combination of calorie reduction and increased exercise. The process may take time, often extending until weaning, but it is essential to prioritize a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals for both the mother and the baby's well-being.

What is Citrus Naringin and how does it affect the human body?,"It is a natural chemical compound known as a bioflavanoid found in grapefruit, giving it its bitter flavor.
This powerful bioflavonoid has antioxidant and antifungal properties, and as such may help prevent cancer and atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), as well as a number of other ailments.

Naringin also works synergistically with other nutrients, increasing the bio-availability (how much nutrient is absorbed by the body) and therefore maximizing the health benefits of these nutrients.

It is important to note this citrus extract interferes with enzyme activity in the intestines, and therefore can inhibit the breakdown of certain drugs. That is why you should consult with your physician if you are on any medication before eating grapefruit. It is a fruit extract.  Citrus naringin is an appetite suppressant that can negatively interact with other drugs-like caffeine, which is also in these pills.

Fatigue is different from drowsiness. In general, drowsiness is feeling the need to sleep, while fatigue is a lack of energy and motivation. Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of indifference or not caring about what happens) can be symptoms of fatigue.

Fatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked.

The pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if you wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, you may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid. On the other hand, if you wake up with a low level of energy and have fatigue that lasts throughout the day, you may be depressed.
========================

Do you have any underlying illnesses? Is your thyroid funcioning correctly? Are you sleeping soundly? Each of these can lead to fatigue. Have your doctor do some tests for thyroid function and ask your mate if you snore, if so, have a sleep study done. If you have an illness, don't take the vitamins without your doctor knowing what you are taking. (For instance, Warafin+Vit.K= trouble.)

Your work place can be making you sick too. Check the info on the webmd link below to see if that is the problem. 

There are so many reasons to be tired its hard to answer your question. The best way I think is to say what is ""not"" causing the lethargy and you will be led to what is causing it.

Good Luck~

WHat kind of sit-up is the best and most effective?,"Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.

Is there a natural cure for menstrual cramps?,"the only cure i know is menopause; but i'm a guy, i dont know squat about women. People have been unable to identify a single cause of PMS.

tunnel syndrome, you may have a thyroid disorder.

 

If you have you experienced female problems (tumors, fibroids, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, PMS, cramps, (dysmenorrhea), amenorrhea, female cancers, spontaneous abortion, cyclic seizures, dry vagina and infertility), weight problems (usually high, sometimes low), gallbladder disease (six times higher in women with excess estrogen or on birth control pills or ERT), heart disease, cancer, colon problems, low blood sugar, attention deficit disorder (ADD), adrenal exhaustion from excess secretion of adrenaline, and osteoporosis (from excess estrogen leading to excess adrenaline and then to excess cortisol), you may have thyroid disease.

 

Why is it so important to take note of your symptoms?

If you don't get your thyroid disease diagnosed and start a course of proper treatment, you are setting yourself up for many problems down the road.

How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.

Lowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.

However...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  

If you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing! They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though. If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  

I had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  

Eating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP. The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed. The surgery isn't as bad as you think it may be.","Reducing saturated fats may shrink gallstones made mostly of cholesterol.

Perseveration essentially means an obsessive focus on a narrow topic. Don't know a lot about it, but perseverant eating is a pattern of eating whereby a child eats only one or two foods and rejects all others (i.e. will eat only noodles and peas).

I'm looking for advice on gout pain. I do not want to take a prescription. Anything to use to stop reocurrance,"Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). Hyperuricemia usually does no harm, and most people with high levels of uric acid in the blood never develop gout. When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, uric acid may form crystals that accumulate in the joints. The exact cause of hyperuricemia sometimes goes undiscovered, although inherited factors (genes) seem to play a role. Gout can seem to flare up without specific cause or can be brought on by factors such as being overweight, eating meats and seafood that are high in chemicals called purines, taking certain medications (especially aspirin and diuretics), and drinking too much alcohol.

My own father and aunt have suffered with gout.  This is often a forerunner to diabetes. Here are a few things you can do to prevent an ""attack"" of gout.

1)Ease up on red meat. NEVER eat rare meat.  Purines are contained in  Beef,Pork,Lamb,Seafood,
Yeast (used in beer and bread),Alcoholic beverages, particularly beer,and Bacon.

2) Drink lots of water.  If you were drinking enough water your kidneys would filter the uric acid.

3) Drink low fat milk. This will help ""eat"" the uric acid from your blood.

Is it true you should not work out the same muscle group every day?,"Working out the same muscle group every day just makes the muscle larger or blukier. Tissue are packed into highly arranged bundles. When you work out you are actually contracting and relaxing the tissue that makes up the muscle. As you move your muscle some of the tissue break down causing the pain and friction. Resting a day between working out just gives time for the muscle to repair the broken down tissue. The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when you work out the next day you rely on other tissue  that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that you are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if you do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down. Doctors don't usually recommend you to work out the same muscle group every day because they believe that the muscle should be fully repaired before you work out. In the Army, they would have us do an Easy Day, then a Hard Day.  Easy Day was basic warm-up followed by soccer or whatever.  Hard Day was warm-up followed by multiple mile run, workout in the gym, whatever.  They feel that it is required.

As for the muscle burn, that happens because you are burning the muscle and fat, to my understanding.  Depending on whether you are trying to build-up your muscles, gain tone, or lose weight, you will get different effects for different types of workouts. yes, you are suppose to work a different muscle group everyday. Because you don't want your muscles to get used to the same thing everyday then it becomes routine your body will be so used it that it will not burn fat and build muscle as much as it would if you change it up everyday. If you don't feel burn after your exercise you could be doing them wrong you should feel some burn. I workout twice a day everyday, and there are days when i will work out my arms in the morning and then come home and workout my arms again in the evening. they say you should work out your muscles as much as possible for they burn the most calories. Also, about the burn in your muscles, i don't  feel the burn all the time, but i can guarantee if you, if you are doing the exercise right, then you will see results within 6 weeks. It is always best to rotate the muscles you excersize.  Reason is that you do not want to end up 'muscle heavy', IE:If you only work one set of muscles, let's say in your arms, you will have tremendous arms, and not tremendous anything else.
Once the burn leaves, you are keeping them fit, but not adding to the bulk of the muscle.  hope this helps Ding!  What winnie said.  All you are doing working the same muscles every day is damaging them, you get a much better benefit if you rest them and allow the muscle to heal.

And that ""if you do not feel the burn"" is the old philosophy of ""No paing, no gain"" which is basically now to be considered a load of horse crap.","Working out the same muscle group every day can lead to muscle enlargement or bulkiness as tissues are densely packed in organized bundles. During exercise, the muscle tissues contract and relax, causing some breakdown and resulting in pain and friction. Resting a day between workouts allows for the repair of the broken-down tissues. This rest is essential as it forces reliance on unaffected tissues in the muscle group during subsequent workouts, contributing to muscle development. Doctors typically advise against daily workouts for the same muscle group, emphasizing the need for full muscle recovery before exercising again. In the military, the practice of alternating between Easy Days and Hard Days is common, allowing for adequate recovery. Muscle burn during exercise is believed to be a result of burning both muscle and fat, with different workout types producing varied effects on muscle building, toning, or weight loss. Rotating muscle groups in workouts is recommended to prevent the body from adapting to a routine, promoting effective fat burning and muscle development. Feeling a burn during exercise is considered normal, indicating that the workout is targeting the muscles correctly. It's advised to rotate exercises to avoid becoming 'muscle heavy' in one area and to allow muscles to heal and grow effectively.

Is my child at risk of Bird Flu while feeding ducks are any other birds/petting zoos?,"Sure there is a chance, but it is very unlikely. The bird flu virus is found in avian feces. The more you come into contact with bird feces, the greater your exposure. But the media has blown bird flu out of proportion. Only people with intimate contact with birds, in Asia the poor live with chickens in their houses, have gotten it. It is very difficult to spread through the air and it doesn't pass from human to human. The reason why it is so 'news worthy' is that it is a brand new strain no one in history has been exposed to and therefore no one has a natural immunity/resistance to, once you get it your immune system doesn't recognize it and put up a fight.

Don't worry about getting a flu shot. While you can't get the flu from a flu shot (a common myth), it won't protect you. The World Health Organization predicts the 3 most common strains every year and combines them in a single shot. Unfortunately these are only predictions, and there are over 3000 strains.

Viruses can swap genetic material and do so often. If bird flu gained the ability to be spread through the air and from person to person then we would have a disaster. Until then, I'd be more worried about the diseases your child will catch from other children. not a very big chance because we live in the U.S and it is in Japan! A minor risk.

Does anyone know what Addison's disease is?,"Addison's disease (also known as chronic adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism) is a rare endocrine disorder, first described by British physician Thomas Addison.

It is estimated that it affects about 1 to 2 in 100,000 people.

It occurs when the adrenal glands, seated above the kidneys, fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone.

Addison's disease refers specifically to primary adrenal insufficiency, in which the adrenal glands themselves malfunction; secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to adequately stimulate the adrenal glands. Addison's Disease is a disease caused by partial or total failure of adrenocortical function, which is characterized by a bronzelike pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, anemia, weakness, and low blood pressure. Addison's disease is an endocrine or hormonal disorder that occurs in all age groups and afflicts men and women equally. The disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body.

Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, in some cases, the hormone aldosterone. The disease is also called adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism. check out this link for more information - http://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw65865 It is a dysfunction of the adrenal gland that results in inadequate secretion of steroids the body needs to function (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids).  The most common cause is autoimmune (the body's own defense system attacking the adrenal gland).  Treatment requires replacement of these steroids with medication (like hydrocortisone tablets or fludrocortisone).

how does 1 get rid of chronic constipation?,"Try getting a good amount of fiber everyday.  Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor. Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.

Fortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.

Since dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.

A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.

Regular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.

If you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.

Laxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. 
Lemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. 
Orange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. 
Licorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. 
Grapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. 
Castor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. 
Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!
When it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies? are you a meat lover? if so, change your life style. be a vegetarian and fruitarian Eat lots of fruit and when you eat breads and cereals make sure that they are whole grain. Also drink lots of water. If that doesn't work, see your doctor you may have something blocking your bowel tract or it may be constricted.","Constipation can be attributed to several factors like poor eating habits, lack of exercise, lack of fibrous diet, lack of drinking fluids other serious illnesses like bowel constriction.

does being cold causes a cold?,"A ""cold"" (runny nose, sinus drainage, sneezing, miserable feeling) is called acute rhinitis.  It's a inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat and is caused by a virus.   

There are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause you to have acute rhinitis. You must be exposed to the virus before you can ""catch a cold."" 

Sneezing causes airborne particles.  Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow you to get the a cold.  Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).

The virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. 

Hand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold. Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system. Research has shown that being ""cold"" does not make you more susceptible to colds. I put cold in quotes because cold is a relative term.  For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, ""cold"" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.

Another reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.  When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher.  These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.

Still, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether you are in Chicago or LA. 

It's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold).  

It could be that a good number of cases of colds are just ""cold stress"" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather.  I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through.  

We have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit. When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.  If you wear the hat and gloves and coat, when you are exposed to germs in the air and on surfaces, you will be more able to fight it off before it makes you really ill.","Experiencing a ""cold"" (acute rhinitis) is caused by a virus, and being exposed to the virus is necessary to catch a cold. Airborne particles from sneezing or touching surfaces with the virus can introduce it to the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is recommended to minimize the risk of catching a cold. While being cold itself does not directly make you more susceptible to colds, there is a correlation between colder weather and an increase in colds, possibly due to factors such as spending more time indoors and increased exposure to others' colds.

How large will my penis grow?,"Use a medical traction device such as the Andro Penis. This method is based on exerting a gradual tractive force of 600 to 1500 grams to permanently expand the blood-carrying chambers (the largest being the corpus cavernosa) of the penis.

This is why the left ventricle - the chamber that pumps freshly oxygenated blood out of the heart - is usually the location of most thickening.  

Since this is a progressive disease, there can sometimes be no symptoms at all.  However, as the disease progresses, the thickened walls leave less room for blood in the chambers.

when the power of pregnancy of a mature female is most active?,"I just answered another VERY similar question in the pregnancy section, so I'll just repost it here, verbatim.

Taken from http://www.ovulation-calculator.com/conception.htm

Understanding how the menstrual cycle functions - and what happens during ovulation - is key to the successful prediction of ovulation. But what happens exactly? Let's look at the dynamics of fertility and conception.

During your menstrual cycle, there are far more infertile days than fertile days. The fertile days are days when there is a possibility for conceiving. However, within your fertile period - the window of opportunity for conception - there are days of ""peak fertility"". Identifying these peak times, and planning accordingly, can help maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.

The Dynamics of Fertility
A woman's fertile period during her menstrual cycle, on average, lasts about 9 days. The most fertile period consists of the few days before ovulation. There are a number of reasons why this is the most fertile time. First of all, the amount of cervical fluid increases - and the consistency of the mucus changes substantially (from being sticky and cloudy to becoming transparent, white, and slippery). The purpose of this change is to create a healthy medium for the sperm to survive and travel in. Given a fertile environment, sperm can live several days. The egg, on the other hand, can live only 24 hours - so timing is important. At the moment of ovulation, the body temperature begins to rise to create a warmer, more hospitable environment for a fertilized egg. Also, the cervix will start to rise, soften, and begin to open up.

Hormones and Ovulation: The Release of the Egg
During ovulation, a number of different hormonal changes take place. Early in the menstrual cycle, a hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone - or FSH - enables your ovaries to nurture eggs. Within the ovaries, follicles house each individual developing egg. The follicles that hold the eggs will secrete estrogen. As the menstrual cycle progresses, the follicle containing the developing egg moves toward the surface of the ovary. Immediately before ovulation, the follicle begins secreting estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen helps the uterine lining thicken and expand, and increases blood flow to the uterus. Progesterone causes the glands of the uterine lining to form secretions that help nourish a fertilized egg.

Ovulation
By definition, ovulation is the process of an ovary releasing an egg from the follicle - permitting the egg to float down the fallopian tubes. On average, the first phase of the menstrual cycle last two weeks. Directly prior to ovulation, another hormonal change takes place - the LH Surge. LH (or Luteinizing Hormone) is the hormone that actually facilitates ovulation: it causes the egg to separate from the ovarian surface. Ovulation predictor tests function by detecting this LH Surge, thus alerting the woman that ovulation is about to take place.

Once released from the ovaries (post-ovulation), the egg can survive for about 24 hours. This means that sperm (which can live several days) must be present to fertilize the egg. Following ovulation, the egg enters the fallopian tubes and continues toward the womb. Typically, conception - the uniting of the egg and the sperm - will take place in the fallopian tube, and then the fertilized egg will continue its passage to the uterus and implant in the uterine wall. For pregnancy to take place, fertilization of the egg must be followed by a successful implantation.

Following ovulation, the luteal phase begins, marked by an increase of the hormone progesterone, which strengthens the uterine lining (endometrium) and causes the body temperature to increase, facilitates changes in the cervical fluid, and alters the position of the cervix.

Within 24 hours, if the egg has not been fertilized, it will simply disintegrate after reaching the uterus. Without fertilization - and i Let's vote!","For information purposes, during the menstrual cycle, there are more infertile days than fertile days, with the most fertile period lasting about 9 days. The peak fertility days occur just before ovulation when hormonal changes lead to increased cervical fluid, a rise in body temperature, and changes in the cervix's position. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) nurtures developing eggs in the ovaries, and estrogen and progesterone secretions from follicles prepare the uterus for a fertilized egg. Ovulation, triggered by Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge, releases an egg that can survive for about 24 hours. For conception, sperm must be present during this time. Following ovulation, the luteal phase begins with increased progesterone, preparing the uterus and causing temperature changes. If the egg remains unfertilized, it disintegrates within 24 hours.

"if i am breastfeeding, what should i do to lose weight?","The wonderful thing about breastfeeding is that it burns an extra 300-500 calories a day! I was back down to 125lbs at 4 months after my baby was born and he was exclusively breastfed. You are able to do any exercise that is comfortable for your postpartum body. The only thing that is probably not okay are weight loss pills or supplements as they could pass through your milk to the baby; I would recommend checking them with a lactation consultant before using them. While breastfeeding, losing weight CAN be more difficult.  Most women find that they do not lose all of their ""baby"" weight until they wean (unless, like me, you had plenty of extra weight before the baby, and your body isn't all that concerned about if that pound is a ""baby"" pound or a ""too many chocolate donuts"" pound!).  However, weight loss during breastfeeding is possible (living proof!).  The best way to go is to reduce the number of calories you eat and increase your exercise (I know, it's not as fun as taking a diet pill, but it lasts longer!).  While breastfeeding, your body uses about 500 calories a day to make milk for baby.  The most important thing for you is to make sure the foods you are eating are 80-90 % healthy (like during pregnancy).  If you eat junk, your baby will still get good milk, but your body will suffer because you will not get the vitamens and minerals you need.

The human body needs water to maintain enough blood and other fluids to function properly.

"Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake, as I have to drop about 30 pounds.  Does it really work?","Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.

Food journals can help keep portions under control. For example, don't just write that you ate chicken for dinner. Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was. And how many pieces you consumed. Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet. If you are not seeing a dietician, you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid.

Wondering if you've eat enough servings of fruit and vegetables? A food journal can help you figure it out. While it's not helpful to everyone, many people report food journal success.

No matter what you're weight loss or eating goal, scribbling your snacking habits down is a good idea, experts say.

A few things you can do to lose pounds is:
Exercise, eat healtheir, run..and tons of those stuff. Here's soemthign that works.
A person eats 3 meals a day fully. And lets pretend each meal is 1 pound (not necessarily.)

Eat 5 meals a day, BUT instead of 1 pound, .5 of a pound..So it will be easier. Instead of breakfast having cereal, biscuits, dounughts, muffin...etc try having a cereal for breakfast, then one hour later having the muffin, skipping the biscuits and doughnuts.

Can hypnosis therapy help with sexual inhibition or sexual dysfunction?,"Yes, hypnosis can help.  It really depends on the issue being addressed.  Hypnosis is not a magic wand.  Sexual dysfunction is an interesting one because many times the cause is something physical. I have told people to see their doctor first and it turns out that they are diabetic or some other health related issue.  Dysfunction is one of the leading indicators that there are other things going on that need to be checked out.  If every thing is ok and you want a little boost, hypnosis can be great.  Doing it with your partner can be wonderful. Much of hypnosis is about belief and trust.  Making the avenues of communication and trust stronger between partners will always help. 

In the case of inhibition, hypnosis is not mind control.  It can't be use to make you do something that you don't want to do.  It can be used to make you more comfortable with an idea that you chose to explore.  It can be use to help you explore why you are uncomfortable with a subject and if these inhibitions are something you want to modify.  Hypnosis is a tool to get to the solutions that you want arrive at.  Again, it is not a magic wand that will take you there.  You have to do some work. Yes I suppose it might heres an article on it
http://science.howstuffworks.com/hypnosis.htm Possibly. But wouldn't a person prefer to know why he has this issue? Wouldn't he prefer to be in control of changing his own life? 

It's also possible that the problem originates due to a control issue. Think about it. If a person has an issue due to who is in control, why would he (or how would he be able to) sit in a chair and allow someone else to reprogram his mind?  

Not everyone can be hypnotized, anyway. Certain people are simply resistant to others tampering with their brains.

I'm not any kind of therapist, but I certainly don't suggest hypnotherapy. People should work out their problems while they are in control of themselves, and take responsibility for their own actions. And suppose the hypnotherapy doesn't work? Is it the hypnotist's fault? No, but some people would use that excuse.

And besides, even if the hypnotherapy did work, you're still only putting a band-aid on the issue, because you're only concentrating on the sexual dysfunction. The underlying problem for the sexual dysfunction could be wreaking havoc in other areas of your life, without you being aware.

Would I have had a herpes outbreak by now??,"I say you get off the internet and get checked out you may have something more serious than herpes with a fever and diarhea. Drs. have to be confidential about your problem so go out of town if your scared someone will see you at the clinic. It can take up to two to three weeks for herpes to erupt with physical lesions after being infected, so it is possibly too soon to have an outbreak.  However everyone responds differently to herpes in the initial infection phase, and some people never break out (about 25%), and many only have very mild symptoms, yet they are contagious (called asymptomatic viral shedding).  So even if you don't see an outbreak, that doesn't mean you don't have herpes.  If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.  If you don't break out, you need to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time you were exposed to get a blood test done for herpes antibodies.  It will tkae that long for your body to produce a detectable level with high certainty.  Be sure to get an antibody test for both herpes 1 and 2, that tests for IgM antibodies.

"I have a soar throat and mouth ulcer now, it is there for a week now. Any natural way or home ideas?","I recently answered a similar question but only dealing with sore throat.  The best natural method I am familiar with is licorice.  A double clinical study of patients with nonspecific sore throat tested licorice tea (throat coat brand) and found a significant reduction in throat pain as compared with placebo in as little as 10 minutes.  Patients were told to consume this tea 4-6 times per day.

Licorice tea will probably also help with the pain of the mouth sore, even if it does not make the sore heal faster, but it might help with that too.

Licorice has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help with the blister.

One warning, though,  is that you should not consume too much licorice, especially if you have blood pressure problems.  A case report from the Netherlands reported that excessive consumption of licorice tea (about 3 liters per day, so a lot) can temproarily raise blood pressure.  This rise in blood pressure may drop back down after licorice tea stops being consumed, but it may take time.

Why are people (me) plagued with dandruff? How the heck do I get rid of it? I have tried almost EVERYTHING!!?,"Dandruff is thought to be caused by a form of a skin condition called eczema, which causes increased shedding of normal scalp skin cells. Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse.
Here are some tips.
Learn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. 
Shampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. 
Cut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. 
Eat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. 
Get a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. But wear sunscreen on your face and body. I know for my daughter, we use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo.

What are some non-expensive ways to get rid of a cold?,"home made chicken soup Although it's a bit late now, the cheapest means of getting over a cold is a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a reduction of stress in your lifestyle. That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.

Here's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.

And, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again. Your body adapts to that viral strain. If you catch another cold right after you just get over your last one, it's a new cold and you came down with it because your immune system was already depressed from the most recent one. Chicken soup and Advil cold&Sinus...works wonderful and just het some rest The least expensive is just plain rest and taking care of yourself.

If you've been taking a lot of cold meds, they can mess with your system and cause you to not sleep well.  If it's the stuffiness that keeps you from sleeping try a vaporizer to help clear your sinuses. (A crock pot set on low makes a good vaporizer.  Just be careful where you place it.)

For stuffiness and headaches, you can make a mixture of a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a few drops of lavender oil then massage around your eyes. (Don’t get real close to your eye.)  Placing a warm moist cloth over your eyes after the massage will also help. Gargle with 3% H2O2 every hour until relieved. An excellent remedy is ginger tea.Add a small tsp each of ginger pwd, fennel seeds pwd,cinnamon pwd and a pinch of clove pwd to a cup of boiled water and let it sit covered for 10 mts.Strain and drink.You can have this tea a couple of times a day.

What is the best way to treat dandruff?,"Dandruff can have a number of causes, from dry scalp to dermititis. It is now commonly believed that most dandruff is caused by a fungus like organism. The use of over-the-counter medicated shampoos works pretty well for most people. Neutrogena T/Gel and Nizoral are two shampoos that I have used that work very well.

Why are there so many terrible psychiatrists?,"I could answer this several different ways. Peter Breggin is the author of ""Talking back to Prozac"" and ""Toxic Psychiatry"". David Healy is anti-drug but pro-ECT (electroconvulsive therapy which 'treats' bipolar and depression).  Dr. John Burrows has his own podcast, in which he says that benzos are ""evil"" or very close to it. 

So clearly, there are some 'good' psychiatrists not necessarily corrupted by the pharmecuetical company. My brief scan of the research on Google Scholar, searching for ""psychiatric ward culture"" indicates that psychiatrists rely on an authoritation methedology -- do what I say without asking why. 

I also think that little is known about the antipsychotics. My father, a biochemist, calls them ""blunt instruments"" and they are. I counsel people to stick to the least-invasive remedy. (ie. mood stabilizers for bipolar rather than antipsychotics (also called neuroleptics.) Peter Breggin has an entire essay at http://www.breggin.com on why their use should be limited.

I would get a second opinion from ancupunturists, cranial-sacral massage therapists (mine helped me a lot, although was not around like my psychiatrist was), and even a good alternative pharmacy if you have one in your area. I had a manic episode, and found a Total Omega-3 supplement (fish-based) to really improve at least my own sense of health. There is scientific evidence emerging that Omega-3 helps with depression and possibly bipolar.

I could rant on and on on this topic. But if you go to my portal at http://health.wikispaces.com and register you will get access to all my thoughts as they evolve. (Think of it as a blog where I am encouraging other people to research and contribute.) I think you and your shrink are victims of the American Pharmaceutical Industry.  The biggest drug dealers in history.  So powerful most doctors are under pressure to over-prescribe.  Doctors also have to deal with confused patients who read about new drugs in magazines see new drugs on television and  are being market new drugs in commercials and advertising.

 At the other end of the spectrum you have the real lack of psychiatric care under the American Health Insurance Industry.

So there you have it: we are left with bills and pills to solve everything. Forget the pod bay doors, man, you opened the floodgates! Hit-the-nail-on-the-head and won the 64 thousand dollar question all at the same time!!! Something is PROFOUNDLY WRONG with many, many, many of these ""physicians."" Re-read your question and you have your answer... I have had similar experiences. Sigmund Freud took them into the ""dark abyss"" of ""Analysis"" and today they have cleaned themselves up, put on nice clothes, will ""cheerfully"" give you 10 to 15 minutes of their ""holier than thou"" time, charge you a fortune for Evaluation and Management (E & M) and dispense inummerable combinations and complexities of ""pharmacologic agents.""

how do i grow muscles faster ?,"take green tea, and my trainor said to mix up ur work out one day lift maybe 5 pd barbell in one hand and 10 in the other, if u can lift more great!then the next day switch them, so ur body is always tearing and guessing never have a routine work out, do green tea because it helps ur immune system and replenishes ur body, but try useing different amounts of weight like everyother time good luck! do you know your body type, it can realy help you not to work against your self, try to search in wikipedia ''body type'' Workout 24 hours a day. working out anything past 45 min is a waste of time because you end up destroy your own current muscles for energy, and also leads to overtraining which will also waste your muscle and prevent them from recovering thus will not build you any new muscle. So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity.

also 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above.


now here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which you will gain them:

the secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways:

-changing the order of the exercise each work out
- changing the speed at which you lift the weights, slow or faster
-super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises
- giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part
- negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep
- stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight you can to muscle failure (when you can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeat

that's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so you must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly.

also there is the diet component:

proteins: make sure you eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that you arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat.

carbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portion

fats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oils

make sure you do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow.

make sure you sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep.

make sure you eat no more than 1 hour after your work outs

make sure you have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible 

throw junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. 

keep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body part

any more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck work them 3x 20 sets per day with weights rest every second day and drink a low fat milk and banana slurpee to help produce and heal worked muscle tissue use weights of 20 and 30 pounds................ creatin is the main matter of muscles.so buy a medicine which contents creatin in it.",Knowing your body type can help build muscle.,information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"

after having showers with hot water or getting hot(due to blankets) during sleeping i get an allergy?,"I suffer from the same thing.

It's hives.  

It can be an allergic reaction - if you're having other symptoms of allergies like watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, then it could just be an extension of whatever you're allergic to.

But hives can be brought on by heat without an allergic reaction.  Nobody knows for sure why it happens in the absence of other allergies.  But heat brings blood to the surface of the skin and allows hives to develop.

If you scratch them, they will spread.  Sometimes mine itch when they're just flat red wheals, and sometimes they don't... but if I so much as touch a wheal before it swells, POOF! Not only does it swell and itch a lot worse, but it tells all its friends and neighbors, and it spreads like wildfire.

I have had chronic hives for 6 months now - due to allergies.  I take a Claritin and a Singulair every day, and it still doesn't completely get rid of them.  I am undergoing allergy shots.

One other thing you can do is to get some Ivarest. You can find it at Walgreens. I've tried everything else on the market, and only Ivarest keeps the hives down for longer than an hour or so.  It's a little more expensive, but a tube will last me several weeks, instead of just a day or two like a tube of Benadryl cream.

You can also take Benadryl before a shower to help keep the hives down to a minimum.

If you don't get relief of them within about six weeks, go to the doctor and get tested for allergies.

Other than hydration, I dunno... think of your goal (if you have one) and think about how much you want that goal. Get some close support. I'm here for you even if no one else is! People who lose weight are my heroes. Maybe you can't. Medical science lately has proving that some people always feels like eating. Maybe you should check that out at your med. don't resist, if you just ate and you feel guilty to eat again , try a snack,e.g fruit, something light. It's not so much how much or when you eat as it is what you eat - It's healthy to eat 4 to 6 small meals a day - Just make smart choices about what you eat.  I reccomend Body For Life - it worked for me. I knew nothing about diet or exercise. I didn't even know what a healthy portion was until I read that book. Eat tons of rice cakes and drink a lot of water. Just like you would resist anything else, the best way is to avoid it altogether. Avoid thinking about food, change your environment so that you can't smell, see, or hear about food. Also exercise is a good way to lower your hunger. Distract yourself. Find a hobby or something else to focus on.

Eat three square meals a day with maybe a healthy mid-day snack. That'll keep you healthy and satisfied. Do some physical activity. If you're depressed (which can cause overeating) go out and do something fun. Do not isolate. The only way to truly eat healthy is to keep away from bad food.  Get rid of the chocolate, twinkies, 
donuts,etc.  NO BUFFETS!!!  Do not skip meals either.  It slows your metabolism, and you get hungry and go for the first thing you see.

However, if you want to know the best time of year to get pregnant I would say January-February or May-June.

"When you are on a plateau in weight loss, what is the quickest way to get the scales to move downward again?","Congratulations on your weightloss thus far! 

I lost 55 pounds once. I hit a couple of nasty plateaus. Here are some strategies I used to get over them:

- Break out the measuring cups and spoons and food scale again. I tended to get lazy about measuring my food over time. While on a plateau I forced myself to measure everything that went into my mouth that wasn't already pre-packaged and labeled with nutritional information.

- Try a different type of workout. If I'd been doing the exercise bike regularly, instead of pushing myself harder on the bike and getting frustrated, I'd move to a different machine - the stair stepper, elliptical, or rower. My body wouldn't be as used to the other machines - they'd work out different muscles so I wouldn't have to push myself as hard and would get more benefit.

- Re-examine the reasons why you want to lose weight. Cut out some pictures from magazines of how you'd like to look, and also break out pictures of how you looked before your weightloss, and stick them on the fridge and food cabinets. It'll remind you of how you don't want to become and where you really want to be at the time you're making a judgement about what foods to eat.

- Wear a pair of jeans that is really tight around your waist. (around the house probably is best ;-) ). It'll make you think about your stomach more and motivate you to eat less and work out more. 

- Limit the amount of times you eat out per week, or if you eat out, have them bring out a take-home box when they bring out your food so you can spoon out half to take home right away so it's not sitting there on your plate tempting you while you eat. Reduce food intake and increase exercise.  Those are the only options. First congratulations on your weight loss.  But sadly the battle is never over.  It's a constant effort to keep the pounds off.  But I can say that I personally just lost 15lbs, simply by not drinking any more soda.  So if your still drinking high carb drinks......stop!.  You'd be suprised how much you can lose just by doing that. good job!   i lost 10 lb's in 1 mo. by cutting out alot of fatty meats and gravy's..i stuck mostly with turkey,chicken and drink lot's of diet soda..also the subway diet works good too..and i did alot of walking..good luck","To facilitate weight loss, consider revisiting portion control by using measuring tools and a food scale. Introduce variety into your workout routine by exploring different machines such as the stair stepper, elliptical, or rower. Reassess your weight loss motivations by creating visual reminders, including pictures of your desired look and images from before your weight loss journey. Wearing snug jeans can serve as a constant reminder to stay mindful of your fitness goals. Additionally, limit eating out and practice portion control by immediately packing half of your restaurant meal to take home.

what does it mean when diastolic blood pressure is over 100?,"It means you need to quit eating salted food, lose weight, and exercise. If this is not a once-off measurement, but that your diastolic pressure has been checked a few times and it is definitely still over 100 mmHg, it means that you have high blood pressure.

Normal blood pressure is now considered as a systolic blood pressure of below 120 mmHg plus a diastolic blood pressure of below 80 mmHg.

Diastolic blood pressure is the blood pressure when your heart is relaxed in between the beats; compare that to the blood pressure when the heart is beating, which is called the systolic blood pressure. That is why the diastolic blood pressure is always quoted lower than the systolic blood pressure. Which of the two is more important is still up for discussion. Well, I know that 140/90 is considered to be the beginning of high blood pressure. What Is ""Normal"" Blood Pressure?

There are several categories of blood pressure, including:

Normal: Less than 120/80 
Prehypertension: 120-139/80-89 
Stage 1 hypertension: 140-159/90-99 
Stage 2 hypertension: 160 and above/100 and above

If diastolic pressure consistently measures above 100 mmHg, it indicates hypertension. Normal blood pressure is defined as a systolic reading below 120 mmHg and a diastolic reading below 80 mmHg. The significance of diastolic versus systolic pressure is still a topic of discussion.

what is the best way to go through the grieving process of loosing a loved one?,"It does take time to grieve, and it often takes much longer than people think. This is especially true if you witnessed the violent death of your fiance. 

One of the ways that people grieve is to talk about the person they lost, the event if they witness it, and how their life is different since their loss. One of the problems is that people around you often feel that you should be over it by now, and they may not be as available to listen. So you might want to check out a community bereavement group that might allow you to talk with others over a period of a few months. For many people this helps them to process their loss.

For the record, I don't think you ever ""get over"" someone, but you are able to put the loss in perspective. I've heard people say that ""I haven't forgotten the person, but I can now think about them without crying!""

Your local hospice, hospital, mental health association or even a local funeral home may offer bereavement groups. Most of the time they are free of charge, as well.

Since you did witness the violent death of your fiance, you might also have some issues related to that trauma itself. If you have other symptoms of anxiety or depression you might want to talk this over with your doctor or a mental health professional. Everybody goes through it differently, and it can take time.  You just don't get over someone you love who dies--suddenly or otherwise.  Plus, you say he was killed in front of you--that suggests it may have been violent.  Dealing with that aspect alone is a major undertaking.

If you haven't already, you really need to talk about it with someone--even if it's just your boyfriend.  If he cares for you, he'll at least be a sympathetic ear.  You should consider a professional, too--maybe just a clergyman you know.  They're all trained in some basic counseling skills.  To move on from someone's death means accepting it, and you may need some help with that. Active, healthy grieving requires balance -- balancing the time you spend directly working on your grief with the time you spend coping with your day-to-day life; balancing the amount of time you spend with others with the time you spend alone; balancing your need for help from others with caring for yourself. Focusing too strongly on any single side of these pairings is getting off-track. 
Here are some things others have found useful in their healthy grieving.  

Grieving takes energy that will likely have to be temporarily withdrawn from the usual pursuits of your life. Treat yourself with the same care, tolerance, and affection you would extend to a valued friend in a similar situation.

Healthy grieving is an active process. It is NOT true that, ""You just need to give it time."" One way of understanding the work to be done is to think of grieving as a series of tasks we need to complete (not necessarily in sequence):

* To accept the finality of the loss; 
* To acknowledge and express the full range of feelings we experience as a result of the loss; 
* To adjust to a life in which the lost person, object, or experience is absent; 
* To 'say good-bye,' to ritualize our movement to a new peace with the loss.","For information purposes, grieving, especially after witnessing the violent death of a fiancé, is a process that demands more time than commonly perceived. It involves coping with the profound impact of the loss by discussing the departed individual, the traumatic event, and the subsequent changes in one's life. A significant challenge arises from societal expectations that may pressure individuals to move on quickly, leaving them with limited support.

why do i have backache?,"Well, there are any number of reasons you have a backache, and likewise, any number of remedies. The biggest reason is generally muscle strain. 

Since it's a strain, you can generally handle it much like any other strain (apply gentle warmth to the area to encourage blood flow and reduce activity that cause the problem). I've also found that taking    acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps me more than an asperin does, but that's just me. 

Obviously you should also consider avoiding whatever activity causes these backaches. Make sure you wear flat shoes with proper arch support, sit with your back flush against the back of the chair, lift with your legs, etc.

What's the best way to conquer a nailbiting habit?,"Painting your nails is the best. Hot sauce etc rubs off, but nail polish stays on, and makes your whole mouth taste terrible.

What is Diptheria?,"Diphtheria is an upper respiratory tract illness characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent membrane of the tonsil(s), pharynx, and/or nose. A milder form of diphtheria can be limited to the skin. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, an aerobic Gram-positive bacterium.

Diphtheria is a highly contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the secretions of those infected. Diphtheria was once quite common, but has now largely been eradicated in developed nations (in the United States for instance, there have been fewer than 5 cases a year reported since 1980, as the DPT (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine is given to all school children). Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet.

Signs and symptoms

The respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further.

Low blood pressure may develop in some patients. Longer-term effects include cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy (sensory type)[1]. Diphtheria is a contagious illness caused by a type of bacteria. It can cause breathing and swallowing problems and can damage the heart and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Diphtheria (dif-THEER-e-uh) is a serious bacterial infection, usually affecting the mucous membranes of your nose and throat. The disease typically causes a bad sore throat, fever, swollen glands and weakness. But the hallmark sign is a thick, gray covering in the back of your throat that can make breathing difficult. Diphtheria can also infect your skin.

Signs and symptoms of diphtheria may include:

A sore throat and hoarseness 
Painful swallowing 
Swollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes) in your neck 
A thick, gray membrane covering your throat and tonsils 
Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing 
Nasal discharge 
Fever and chills

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism

Botulism (from Latin botulus, ""sausage"") is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin, botulin, that is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Botulin is the most potent known toxin, blocking nerve function and leading to respiratory and musculoskeletal paralysis.

There are three main kinds of botulism:

*  Foodborne botulism is a form of foodborne illness and is caused by eating foods that contain the botulism toxin. 
*  Wound botulism is caused by toxin produced from a wound infected with Clostridium botulinum. 
*  Infant botulism is caused by consuming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release toxin.

Here are some tips.
Learn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. 
Shampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. 
Cut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. 
Eat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. 
Get a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. But wear sunscreen on your face and body. I know for my daughter, we use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo.

what is thephysiology of thirst?,"Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.

Thirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted.","Thirst and drinking are essential for maintaining body water balance and survival.

Why would a newborn child get johndus?Why yellow skin?Whats the cure?,"Many children are born with JAUNDICE.  When the baby was in the womb, the mother's liver took care of the excess pigment (called bilirubin) in the blood that causes jaundice. It takes a while for the baby's liver to be able to process and eliminate it. 

Mild cases can be treated by exposing baby briefly to sunlight and making sure baby is getting plenty of fluids (breastmilk is best).  More severe cases can be treated by your pediatrician using special light therapy. What is jaundice? 
Jaundice is an illness that can happen in the first few days of a baby's life. It turns your baby's skin, eyes and mouth a yellow color. The yellow color is caused by bilirubin.

Bilirubin is made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. This is a normal process that happens all through life. Bilirubin goes to the liver, where it is changed again. Then it goes into the intestines and the kidneys, and then it goes out of the body. If too much bilirubin builds up in your baby's body, it makes a yellow color called jaundice (say: ""john-diss"").

Jaundice is common in babies and is usually not serious.

Why do some babies get jaundice? 
Red blood cells have a shorter life in babies than they do in adults. This means more bilirubin goes through your baby's liver. If your baby's skin is bruised during birth, more red cells may need to be broken down. Then your baby's liver has to handle even more bilirubin. Sometimes a baby's liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin.


How can I tell if my baby has jaundice? 
You should watch for color changes in your baby's skin. You should also check the whites of your baby's eyes and the pink skin inside your baby's mouth. If they get yellowish, you may want to see your baby's doctor. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to check, except by looking at your baby's eyes and inside your baby's mouth.

Artificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that is not really there. So you might want to check your baby in daylight in a sunny room.

As the amount of bilirubin in the blood increases, your baby's body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby's head down to the chest and even down to the toes.

If your baby's skin is yellow, see your baby's doctor right away. The doctor will take a small amount of your baby's blood and measure the bilirubin in it.


How is jaundice treated? 
If the bilirubin level is not too high, your baby might not need any treatment. Your doctor might just want you to feed your baby breast milk or formula more often.

If the bilirubin level is very high or is getting higher very quickly, your baby will need light therapy. This is also called phototherapy. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in your baby's skin.

For this treatment, your baby is placed under special white, blue or green lights. The baby might also be placed on a special light-producing blanket. Your baby's eyes are covered to protect them from the bright lights. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days.

Phototherapy can give your baby loose stools, temperature problems or dehydration. Your doctor will watch your baby carefully to prevent or treat these problems.

If your baby's bilirubin level gets too high, and phototherapy does not work well enough, the baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby's blood is taken out, and it is replaced with blood from someone else.


Can jaundice hurt my baby? 
Jaundice is not a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous. It can give some babies brain damage.

Your doctor will measure your baby's bilirubin level a number of times. If necessary, your baby will be treated. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby.

 

How long will my baby have jaundice? 
Jaundice lasts for a different time in different babies. Often, the bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is formula-fed.","Jaundice is a common condition in newborns, occurring in the first few days of life, causing the skin, eyes, and mouth to turn yellow due to excess bilirubin. Bilirubin is produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells, and its accumulation leads to jaundice. While mild cases can be treated with sunlight exposure and adequate fluid intake, more severe cases may require special light therapy under a pediatrician's guidance. Jaundice is usually not serious, but very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous, potentially causing brain damage. Monitoring bilirubin levels and appropriate treatment help prevent complications. The duration of jaundice varies among babies, with breastfed infants possibly experiencing it for a longer time compared to formula-fed babies.

"i know its probably a good thing to quit smoking, but i think i am not affected adversley by smokin yeh or no?","i'll tell you what. you go outside and run around the block. when you get back, if you can talk without sounding like you're gonna die, then you have iron lungs. if you pass out before, then you might want to give nicoderm a shot! Oh no. Please keep smoking. More lung cancer patients are good for my hospital. The answer is ""yeh you are being affected adversely""

It may take time to build into a heart or lung condition - but it probably will do that. 

I assume you are an early smoker, with that, you are building a dependence that will make it very difficult to let go of the habit, even when you want to.  I've seen people already diagnosed with heart or lung disease who continued to smoke because the addiction was too strong for them to break.  

Not only are you damaging cells inside your body, but you are damaging your skin.  The most wrinkled people are the ones who have smoked over the years.  You can see  how the smoke constantly building would affect the skin.  Wrinkles around the lips and in the soft tissue under the eyes are the most prevalent in smokers.  Smoking takes the vitamins right out of your body, and can cause the bones and teeth to become weaker.

So, now you see you are damaging your heart & your lungs. Your respiratory system cancels out your breathing.  Cancer is prevalent in throat, tongue, lips, your bones and teeth are unhealthy - and finally, it's gotten to your skin too. 

If that doesn't make you stop - Let me remind you that you are also damaging anyone who happens to be in the room with you while you are smoking.  Second hand smoke has been proven to be as damaging as first hand.

Quit smoking and people will want to be with you more often.  Not only that you will smell better, breathe better and certainly like yourself better.

Plus you will save a lot of money as another side benefit.

Good luck.  Hope you'll give it your best shot.  Never quit quitting. Denial is a wonderfully easy was of saying you're not affected.  It's kind of like a 'James Dean' attitude, like ""it won't happen to me.""  Well, you can be SURE that every time you smoke, damage is being done.  It's kind of like a teenager saying ""we only had sex once."" (and she's pregnant) If this doesn't wake you up, then how about the knowledge that there are many intelligent people out there that have done many tests that will totally disagree with what you just said.  So, you might want to creep up out of that hole you have your head in, and wake up and face the facts.  Smoking kills.  It's really 'sucking' you know! Well it is true that some people smoke for their whole lives without becoming ill from it.  But it is not possible to (not) have adverse affects, your body just cannot function at its full potential while processing that many toxins.  If you are very young or have not been smoking for very long you will feel good, but that does not mean you are not hurting yourself.",Smoking is such an addictive habit that it has been observed that people with terminal illnesses couldn't get rid of the addiction.,experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"

What can I use to help me fall asleep and stay asleep?,"well i listen to music. NyQuil. But if you take it, don't make any plans. It's a coma in a bottle. A few things to try:

Chamomile tea, followed by a lavendar inscence, or candle.

Orange blossom tea, followed by perhaps a soothing wite tea candle/scent.

2 very good methods i use.

Another good combination, which helps in breathing, ect would be a mixture of Lavendar and Camphor inscence chased with a lavendar or orange blossom tea. 

White Tea straight is a bit harsh to drink, but mixed with milk and honey tastes wonderful, and is quite calming.

Dont forget that you need to have a scent while you sleep if you find it hard to sleep.  Don't also to forget that a completly dark room will keep you awake, leave some light filtering into the room, not on you, but indirectly.

Also, ensure that your beddings are clean, and that the room is at a moderate temprature, not too hot, not too cold :)  It is best to keep a mild breeze, from say a ceiling fan on low, or a regular fan on low pointed away from the bed.  Keep the air indirectly on your sleeping space, it keeps your mind calm, as you focus unconciously while you sleep on the air flow.

Some good tips for ya :) Good eating habits, excersize, and Melatonin.  You can get it across the counter. Chamomile tea is excellent for this!  I usually can drop off within 15 minutes of a nice steamy cup.

You may also want to try L-ornithine.  It is an Amino Acid.  You can find this at any natural food store.

I recently found a lump in my breast.?,"You have not mentioned your age. Better consult your doctor. It requires further investigations. If you are truly concerned, consider getting a second opinion from a doctor of your own choosing, NOT one that's been recommended by the doc that gave you the first reading.  That way you know there are no conflicting interests.

Sometimes a lump is just a lump.  Breasts get lumpy during certain times of the month, and goes along with normal cycles.  Calcifications and shadowing are pretty routine findings as well.  If there was something to be concerned about, the first doc would have ordered a biopsy on the lump.  A biopsy is where a needle is inserted into the lump and a sample is taken to be studied, to determine whether it is cancerous. This same time last year I was experiencing the same thing.  No one was ever really sure what the lump was but it wasn't cancerous.  I even had a biopsy after the ultrasound and mammogram showed nothing.  Perhaps your doctor will schedule one for you.  And if nothing still shows up they will schedule you for another ultrasound in six months.
I've had my six month check up, and I'm happy to say IT'S STILL NOTHING!!
I wish you the best.
Be blessed!! My best friend has calcifictions. Has had them for years. She is fine. I have had 3 lumps. All were nothing. 99% of breast ""abnormalities"" (actually not that abnormal) are NOT CANCER. If you have been screened, and still feel concerned, get a second opinion. #1 thing, don't worry. Worry causes more cancer than breast lumps do.

how does 1 get rid of chronic constipation?,"Try getting a good amount of fiber everyday.  Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor. Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.

Fortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.

Since dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.

A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.

Regular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.

If you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.

Laxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. 
Lemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. 
Orange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. 
Licorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. 
Grapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. 
Castor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. 
Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!

what is the best way to go on a diet ?,"I believe diets alone don't work. You need to eat healthy food, fruit, vegetables, whole grains,(no white bread or sugars). Starches and sugars make your pancreas produce insulin. when that happens your body starts to store fat.
Diet and exercise together will produce the best weight loss. Exercise increases your metabolism, burning more calories. It builds muscle which also burns more calories.
Try to eat small meals several times a day in stead of 3 large meals. The body will not think you are starving and store fat. Try the rice diet. A cup of rice at meal times, and one piece of fruit (any kind) w/each meal. It is about 1200 calories a day. Do it for a week, and you will see great weight loss. If you cheat, it will take longer naturally. Diet soda, tea is all okay. Then follow healthy eating habits or you will gain lbs. back. I fear what you really may be asking. But I agree, eating a balanced diet is that absolute best way to go. If you want to do somthing drastic, stop eating sugar all together. I lost 21pounds from not eating white flour and products with sugar content in the 4th ingrediant or higher. I didn't exsersize, but remember this it takes 1500 calories to gain or loose a pound and a calorie is a calorie so, eat foods that are nutrient dense vs. foods that are energy dence(high fat) you can eat more that way. 
carbs(like in oatmeal, bread) and Protien(meats and cheese) have 4calories per gram of food and fat, has 9 calories per gram of food. That's twice as much calories in 1 gram of food, choose wisely. good luck.","It is suggested that adopting a healthy eating regimen is crucial for effective weight management. The advice recommends incorporating nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding starches and sugars that can stimulate insulin production and lead to fat storage. The synergy of a balanced diet and regular exercise is emphasized as the most effective strategy for weight loss, with exercise boosting metabolism and muscle development. The guidance also encourages consuming smaller, more frequent meals to prevent the body from interpreting it as starvation and storing fat. An alternative approach involves the ""rice diet,"" limiting daily calorie intake to approximately 1200 calories through a cup of rice and a piece of fruit per meal, potentially resulting in significant weight loss within a week. For those seeking a more drastic measure, eliminating sugar entirely is proposed, with personal success shared in avoiding white flour and high-sugar content products.

What is strabismus?
If your baby's eyes seem to point in different directions or not focus on the same object, he may have strabismus — a lack of coordination between the eyes. They may appear to be ""crossed"" or one may seem to drift inward, outward, or upward. Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then).

What is amblyopia?
Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye. This can happen if your baby's eyes are misaligned or if he can't see as well with one eye because of nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or something that's blocking clear vision in that eye, like a cataract or a drooping eyelid.

About 3 to 6 percent of children under the age of 6 develop amblyopia. Treatment is most successful before age 5 or 6, although recent research shows that even older children may recover their vision. If ignored, though, amblyopia can result in permanent vision loss. This sounds like a vestibular problem to me.  The nerves in your ears that help you with balance also have connections to the muscles that move your eyes.

Depending on the severity, you may want to see a doctor.  If it's a relatively small spot, you can probably get away with just applying an antibiotic cream (such as Neosporin) to it a few times a day.  Also, you shouldn't use deodorant on that spot either. Perhaps if it is ""burned"" you should let it heal naturely.  The outer layer of skin is constantly being shed.  Hide your armpits until healed.

what causes coughing in asthma?,"Cough is a natural phenomena to bring out any foreign body or any secretion from the lower respiratory tract.  In asthma, there is narrowing of the lower respiratory tract, and the secretions are small in quantity and sticky in nature which also reduces the lumen of the respiratory tract. So to bring that expectoration out cough is produced.  Since it is sticky in nature the person  coughs severely. Some things that can trigger coughing in asthma patients are dust, cold air, overexcertion, perfume, pollen and other enviromental factors. People who have asthma have very sensitive airways,( Also known as RAD Reactive Airway Disease) so when they are exposed to an offending allergen they can start coughing or wheezing.","Asthma is caused by narrowing of the lower respiratory tract, reducing the lumen (airway space) and causing secretions that is sticky.

What  are the symptoms Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?,"Mental retardation is the most common and serious birth defect associated with FAS.  Perhaps the most notable defects in FAS involve the face and eyes. In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss. More than 90 percent of infants with FAS have delays in receptive and expressive language development. Please see the links listed below.

What is a heart murmur?,"I personally was diagnosed with one a few years ago was sent to a cardiologist who said it was nothing to worry about it.  Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals.  I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.

Here's some info from webmd:


In particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called ""innocent"" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.


Though many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.

Within the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.

A healthy heart makes a ""lub-dub"" sound as it beats. The ""lub"" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the ""dub"" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.

Heart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.

Symptoms
Many people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:

    * Chest pain
    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)
    * Breathlessness
    * Fatigue
    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects) it is a hole in the heart murmur is the sound that appear when there is something that disturb the flow of blood when it pass through the valves of the heart It's a sound made as blood flows over a heart valve. Normal heart sounds don't make the ""whoosh"" that a murmur does. Diseased heart valves make eddy currents and so the ""whoosh"" is audible in the doctor's stethescope. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_murmur","You personally received a diagnosis of a heart murmur a few years ago, but when checked by a cardiologist, it was deemed not concerning. Many people, including healthy children and pregnant individuals, may have ""innocent"" heart murmurs that do not require treatment. Some heart murmurs, however, can indicate serious heart problems, such as valve issues or congenital defects. The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. It can be detected during routine physical examinations and, if necessary, further examination by a cardiologist. Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart.

can i get over bipolar disorder without pills?,"go to this website Your ability to cope with Bipolar disorder depends on which type you have, how it is affecting your daily life and a few other factors.  There are a variety of therapies available. Let me give you a very good resource book that has really helped me. It's ""The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide"" -What you need to know, by David J.

Make it a good path, I say, one that leads to where you want to go. A personal insight about me, I will always be a little off --- Quixotic, perhaps. Now I am learning to make it work for me. As for pills -- I am cautious so I am focusing on creating a superior intake of foods just for my special needs. I realize if I eat garbage I probably won't feel good. The food at most grocery stores are dazzling in packaging and undeniabley tasty, and if you analyze what they really are, most are not really food.

should a 2 year old get 12 mg of methadone by iv.?,"Assuming that this child weighs around 25-30 pounds (11-14 kilograms), a typical STARTING DOSE of IV methadone would be 1.1-1.4mg given 2 to 6 times per day.

If the child has been treated with increasingly high doses of methadone (or other drugs like morphine, fentanyl, or Dilaudid) for a long period of time, it is possible that the methadone dosing could progress to very high doses, such as the 12mg you mention.  Examples where this might happen would include treatment of cancer or sickle cell disease.

However, 12mg of IV methadone in a 2-year-old who does not regularly take very high doses of narcotic pain relievers would be totally inappropriate.

how can I ensure that a part of my body gets suffecient blood?,"Generally there are 2 reasons why a part of your body might lack blood, physical and chemical.  Physical reasons might be that the part of your body may be too tight to allow for good circulation.  In this case, you must stretch (eg. yoga or pilates) and exercise to loosen up that area.  Doing heat pack will also help to aid the blood flow temporarily.  One important thing to remember though is that the source of tightness might be completely unexpected.  If you have cold hands, it may be more helpful to stretch your calves or your shoulders depending on your body structure rather than the hand itself.  You must remember to treat your body as a whole.  Chemical reasons could come from your diet or the air you breathe or any other intake (eg. tobacco or drugs).  This could alter the chemical make up of your bloodstream.  In this case, what you would have to do is to remove the chemical that is causing the problem.

What's the best remedy for arthritic hands?,"Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  

There is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. 

When you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.

Results vary with patient.

There are medications that can lessen the impact of the tics and make them less noticeable.  It takes time and patience to find the right combination, depending upon the severity of the Tourettes.  My son has Tourettes, accompanied by OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and ADHD.  It is not uncommon to have Tourettes plus these conditions, or even others.

There has been a breakthrough at Harvard (see link below, click on Genetic Breakthrough) which is cause for hope.

If you have any questions about diagnosing Tourettes for yourself or a family  member or loved one, see a Neurologist.  I have learned that well meaning teachers, parents, pediatricians, nurses or others are not qualified to diagnose this disorder.  See a Pediatric Neurologist (if the person is under 16 or so) or a Neurologist.

Best wishes to you. Cran has the definition correct. No one knows what causes Tourettes. My son has it, but it is not debilitating. Some think that it may be caused by early use of antibiotics.

What is diffence between AIDS an HIV??,"Hi!!

""HIV is the virus that may causes AIDS. HIV belongs to a subset of viruses called retroviruses or slow virus. 


 
This is because it is a progressive disease. HIV is entered through the body through the mucous membranes or thru blood to blood contact. 


Once you get the virus it slowly begins to attack the immune system, killing off healthy immune system cells. The deterioration and destruction of immune function leads to AIDS. 


AIDS is the final stage of the HIV infection. A person is said to have AIDS when the cd4 counts drops below 200 and or a person has 1 or more opportunistic infections. The OIs, as they are called, are normal infections that a healthy person would be able to fight off. 


The four stages of the HIV infection are as follows: 


1) The period following infection is called the window. It is called this because it reflect the window of time between infection and that which antibodies are devlop in a person. The HIV test looks for antibodies not the virus. 


2) The second stage is called seroconversion. This is when the body begins to develop lots of antibodies to fight off the virus in the body. During this period a person may have flu like sympton. Also during this period is said to be very infectious. 


3) The third stage is called symptom free. During this period a person may have no sympton what so ever. This can last any where from 6 months to well over ten years. The medical world is not sure why some people are living sympton free for so long. 


4) The final stage is called AIDS. This is the period when TCELL drop to below 200 and the OI""S are present. 


So, as we see, HIV is a infection that will leads to AIDS. 


The body immune system is slowly being attacked until it is destroyed and can't fight off infections. Once this happens a person is said to have AIDS. AIDS is the final stage.""

I hope the above answers your question.

>>> Naveen Kumar AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome) is a fatal disease caused by a rapidly mutating retrovirus (HIV) that attacks the immune system and leaves the victim vulnerable to infections, malignancies, and neurological disorders.

HIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a retrovirus that causes AIDS by affecting the very immune system cells (T4 lymphocytes) that would ordinarily fight off such a viral infection. HIV is not transmitted by casual contact; transmission requires a direct exchange of body fluids, such as blood or blood products, breast milk, semen, or vaginal secretions, most commonly as a result of sexual activity or the sharing of needles among drug users. Such a transmission may also occur from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth. Saliva, tears, urine, feces, and sweat do not appear to transmit the virus. No. AIDS expands to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is a state of advanced stage of HIV infection. HIV expands to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and is the virus that causes AIDS.

The term AIDS first appeared in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), USA in 1982 to describe "". . . a disease, at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring with no known cause for diminished resistance to that disease"" The first cases of AIDS were identified in the United States in 1981, but it most likely existed here and in other parts of the world for many years before that. 

In 1984 scientists proved that HIV causes AIDS.","HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a retrovirus that can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV belongs to the subset of viruses called retroviruses or slow viruses, as it causes a progressive disease.

The deterioration of immune function eventually results in AIDS, the final stage of HIV infection. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 cell count drops below 200, and opportunistic infections (OIs) occur. The four stages of HIV infection include the window period, seroconversion, a symptom-free stage that can last for varying durations, and the final AIDS stage. It's important to note that HIV is a virus, and AIDS is the advanced stage of the disease that occurs as the immune system is progressively compromised. The transmission of HIV requires direct exchange of certain body fluids, and it is not transmitted through casual contact. The term AIDS was first used in 1982 to describe a disease associated with a defect in cell-mediated immunity.

emotional abuse leaving during good times??,"If you don't love him, then love yourself enough to know you deserve better.  Your kids will adapt to the change over time.  Be strong and stand up to the abuse.  Write yourself a pros and cons list of the relationship. I was once in a emotional abusive relationship but got out of it because it wasn't love I was always sad and he was always bringing me down. My best advice to you is to follow your heart, if it say's that you don't love him then leave because you will never be truly happy with someone that has done you wrong in the past and you don't love any more. He had a chance to treat you right befor he wanted to start being nice. He probably sences that you want to leave him and your tired of the bull----.

This may be temporary if so than you probably should leave him. If not give him a second chance maybe he will change for the good and you may start feeling love for him again.

how do you get rid of the common cold?,"The common cold is primarily different varieties of viruses.  Viruses enter your body when your immune system has been weakened.  This could be due to a number of factors.  The most common is lack of rest.  If you do not receive the proper amount of sleep every night, your immune system is weakened.  

The best way (I have found) get rid of a cold is to get LOTS of rest, drink lots of oj (nonconcentrated), and drinking PLENTY of water.  Water helps to flush out all impurities in your body.  This has always helped me to recover quickly.

Another way to boost your immune system is to a daily mulit-vitman.  Make sure that it has B-12 in it as well.  B-12 is execellent for boosting and maintaining a healthy immune system. Zicam.  It really works.  
It is a zinc compound.
I'm on my first cold of the season, I'm counting on Zicam to shorten it.
I've avoided them so far using this.
I think that the only reason this one got me is because I started on Zicam late as this cold manifested overnight. flush it out
drink as much water and juices with vitamic c as possible. A few years ago, a new natural product hit the market. It's called AIRBORNE and was developed by a second-grade teacher. It is amazing. It is best to take it when you first notice symptoms.  I have used it several times with excellent results. I have also given it to my family members and they too have had their ""cold time"" greatly reduced.

I also take 1000 mg C in the morning and another dose 12 hours later.

http://www.airbornehealth.com/main.html I go nuts with EmergenC (whatever your body doesn't need, it will flush out).  Also, since there's little else that can be done, I just pamper myself with yummy, tasty food, baths, movie rentals, etc...  If you absolutely have to stay home from work, treat it like a mini-vacation.  I seriously believe that eliminating stress and raising your happiness levels makes the cold go away faster. Let it be__It is only the miracle of the body eliminating excess. The worst you can do is to treat the symptom with medication as they will only stop the cleansing process leaving not only the excess but also the residual drug residue. Not a good thing to have your body deal with over the years. The best thing to do is nothing while allowing your body to use its Primary Intelligence  and heal itself Stay warm and away from the ill contacts. 
Take some decongestant and soothers.
Drink some hot soup.
watch TV.
Enjoy The common cold is caused by viruses. There's very little we can do against that. You just have to wait for the battle between your immune system and the virus to finish. Anything you can do to help your immune system would help though, like be careful not to get a second infection or catch anything bacterial, etc. Plenty of fluids and plenty of rest. (up to 12 hours a night)","The shared experiences suggest several approaches to combat a cold. The first emphasizes getting lots of rest, drinking plenty of orange juice and water, and taking a daily multivitamin with B-12.

How can a single mother cope with lonliness?,"I am actually helping a young mother through this very thing. I've been trying to convince her that filling her life with more waste of space guys are not the way to being less lonely, especially since the guys she's attracted to have no life. I'll tell you what I told her. Finish high school. Then take some college courses. Get a job. In between times, surround yourself with a healthy circle of friends...ones that aren't after you for money, a place to sleep, or smokes. Find other young mom's who are doing the same thing. Find a MOPS group...Mother's Of Pre-schoolers. It's a mother's group, who meet regularly (weekly) and get together with their children, sharing tips, recipes, cleaning ideas, and each others problems. Once a month, they hire a babysitter and do something together, like go to a movie, bowling or a number of other fun, wholesome activities. Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get you out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours. If your child is old enough (as young as 3), you can enroll them in Headstart. There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things. Some people will find an grandmother-type person, who is still very active, and you help each other. She can help you with your child, being a surrogate grandma, and she can teach you what she knows. You can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to you and your child. When you get involved, you teach yourself and you teach your child, and you'll end up showing your child how to give of himself to those less fortunate. <*)))>< Geez I would say listen to starshadow and not the guy who accused you of being selfish.

"iam 23 yrs old ...and my height is 5.1,want to grow tall.. but how? want some efective ways to grow tall?","At 23 you have finished growing naturally.

There are no totally safe methods to make you grow.

What is so wrong with being petite?  Taller won't make you any better than you are right now.

Don't think for a second that guys will find you more attractive if you are taller.  The right guy will not care how you look, he'll only care about how you are inside.

(Most movie and tv stars are petite - shorter people look better on screen).

If you want to be tall to be a fashion model, then think again.  Tall is only one of the features required.  You also need endless patience and to get used to being permanently hungry.

My advice is to relax and enjoy how you are. Your growth period is over. It depends on Heridity also. Do not take medicines for growing tall.  Since no meidicnes will make you taller. Back in the 70's and 80's, the Russians did experiments with HGH (human growth hormone) on their olympic athletes.  They grew, some of them died.  They all had Frankenstein facial looks. I once heard that swimming and basketball can help you grow taller by a little bit.

But I think you should start looking into buying some heels or stilettos.  Your height is going to be your height. at this age,metaphasis and diaphasis of your long bones are fused .it is difficult to increase your height more than that.plus it is genetically determined.if your parents are short,then u will tend to attend the same [more or less] same height.but as somebody suggested u can go for swimming or play basket ball [streching exercise]to increse ur height may b by 1/2-1 inch. after 18 its not possible

The mention of a distinct facial appearance among those subjected to these experiments reflects the extreme nature of the interventions. The subsequent explanation provides a general understanding that after a certain age, the fusion of long bone components limits the potential for significant height increase.

can a baby be born not trusting her mom(paranoid)?,"At such a young age it is not the norm to isolate from all people, including family.

PFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis)
What is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)


Taken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. 


The symptoms of PFIC

FIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis.

 These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. 

Itching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. 

Problems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. 


Other common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. 

Vitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. 

Vitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. 

Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. 

Although similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied.

Patients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known.","Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
Are teeth capable of replacing worn enamel?,"No. Our teeth (I'm referring to humans) are brachydont; that is, they only grow for a limited period and afterwards the roots of the tooth become closed. This means that there will be no new materials added, and they will become more and more worn. However, enamel is the hardest tissue in our entire bodies, so normally it doesn't wear off completely during a lifetime.
Other mammals have ever-growing teeth; in that case both enamel and dentine are replaced constantly.
_________________
Streamcat, I hope you're joking. And I thought the question referred to a natural process. Of course dentists can replace enamel with synthetic materials.
-----------------
Can certain animals grow new enamel? Yes, but not in the sense of ""repairing"" their teeth. It's more simple than that: the distal part of the tooth (the functional end) is continually being worn, and the new tissues arise from the basal parts. Those are hypsodont teeth (as rodent incisors and the molars of many herbivores). If you get the chance to examine a rodent skull, you'll see that their incisors don't really have roots, they look like long curved cylinders with an open base. How do those animals do that? If we are smarter than animals should'nt we be able to figure out how to do that? The apical foramen may be small, but its not closed. Fillings are just a patch, I would'nt consider them to replace enamel. Let's say there is carious lesion on the surface of a tooth.  If it is deep into the dentin, then there's no going back.  However, if the lesion is just on the surface of the enamel, it can be restored. No, but human teeth can grow some new dentin in a spot where decay has reached the pulp. Can certain animals grow new enamel?","No, human teeth cannot grow new enamel. Our teeth are brachydont, meaning they only grow for a limited period, and the roots eventually close. The enamel on human teeth does not regenerate or grow back. Once the enamel is worn or damaged, it cannot be naturally replaced. Dentists can use synthetic materials for enamel replacement or restore teeth with fillings, but this is not a natural growth process.

However, they hurt each time you get them adjusted for a few days afterward. I just got my braces a few days ago. They felt like they were loose for the first two days, and it was really hard to eat. I got over speaking difficulties quickly, although the inside of your mouth gets kind of scratched and torn- don't fret, it heals quickly enough. After that you get calouses, so it doesn't hurt anymore. I think the pain felt depends on how old you are when you get them, what kind of treatment you are getting, and how severe your bite is. Lately, I've forgotten I'd had them on. You get used to them. Intially they are painful...also depending on your age and the condition your teeth are in.

"Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake, as I have to drop about 30 pounds.  Does it really work?","Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.

Food journals can help keep portions under control. For example, don't just write that you ate chicken for dinner. Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was. And how many pieces you consumed. Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet. If you are not seeing a dietician, you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid. The Food and Nutrition Information Center Web site provides a USFDA food guide pyramid at www.nalusda.gov/fnic/index.html. The Web site includes USFDA food pyramids for ethnic foods as well.

Wondering if you've eat enough servings of fruit and vegetables? A food journal can help you figure it out. While it's not helpful to everyone, many people report food journal success.

No matter what you're weight loss or eating goal, scribbling your snacking habits down is a good idea, experts say. Then when you see the pounds sliding off -- or piling on -- you can look back through your journal and find out why. I have to keep a food diary because of my daughters feeding tube. It really opens your eyes at what is going on. You should do it. Don't fabricate portions be truthful.

That's rediculious. You may lose 5 pounds.
A few things you can do to lose pounds is:
Exercise, eat healtheir, run..and tons of those stuff. Here's soemthign that works.
A person eats 3 meals a day fully. And lets pretend each meal is 1 pound (not necessarily.)
Something that may work using the one pound ratio is instead of have three 1 pound meals every day, which equal up to three pounds of food every day. Instead of eating 3 pounds every day, with 1 pound meals, try using this:
Eat 5 meals a day, BUT instead of 1 pound, .5 of a pound..So it will be easier. Instead of breakfast having cereal, biscuits, dounughts, muffin...etc try having a cereal for breakfast, then one hour later having the muffin, skipping the biscuits and doughnuts. Then after the muffin, two hours or three hours later, having lunch..

Does anyone know anything about 'perseverent eaters'? I think my six yr old son may be one..?,"A very large percentage of kids are extremely limited in their food tastes.  Ask your friends, and I think you'll hear lots of stories of their children, or themselves, having only eaten peanut butter sandwiches for a year, or some such.

Perseveration essentially means an obsessive focus on a narrow topic. Don't know a lot about it, but perseverant eating is a pattern of eating whereby a child eats only one or two foods and rejects all others (i.e. will eat only noodles and peas). Difficult to tell if it is really a ""disorder"" but it is probably a learned habit. It seems to be something that is more of a concern in England than in the USA.

please explain about types of leukemia?,"There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.

Leukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.

Leukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.

These are the most common types of leukemia:

1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. 
2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). 
3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. 
4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. 
5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here. The Cancer Information Service can supply information about them. Types of Leukemia

"has anyone, EVER personally gotten lockjaw if they didnt get their tetnus shot after getting cut with metal?","You are not likely to have to have many personal reports as the dissease is often fatal -- and the fact that the vaccine is effective.

Another example where vaccines have a had a large positive impact.  In the US, there are not many reported cases (probably under 100 each year) compared with likely one million deaths in other parts of the world (with different hygiene issues and not access to the vaccine). hi my husbands grandma got tetanus and she lived. she was in her garden, and she smashed her toe and she didnt clean it and tried to save her toenail so she put a bandage on it and thats how she got it....she was in the hospital for a long time they couldnt fine out what was wrong with her,,,, her spine was bending the oppsit way and she did have lockjaw....it was an older doc that finally got it right, he took one look at her toe and said she had tetanus... they treated her with antibiotics and she got better but she has a lot of back pain from it even now. hope this helps. Deb","Lockjaw, or tetanus, is a serious bacterial infection that can result from cuts or wounds, especially those caused by metal objects. While personal reports of individuals contracting tetanus without receiving a tetanus shot are relatively rare, it's important to note that the vaccine has proven to be highly effective in preventing this potentially fatal disease. The impact of vaccines, including the tetanus vaccine, has been substantial in reducing the incidence of such diseases. In the United States, reported cases of tetanus are low, likely due to widespread vaccination efforts. However, in other parts of the world with different hygiene conditions and limited access to vaccines, tetanus remains a significant health concern, causing a considerable number of deaths each year.

"when breast cancer is the size of a quarter, how serious is it?","you need to see a doctor NOW! Any amount of cancer is a bad thing -- it is a serious thing and warrants medical intervention. ASAP!

If you are asking about prognosis, there are lots of variables in play as to prognosis of the person you know (I am assuming it is you for the remainder of the answer). Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, specific type of cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to (if any), treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc. And it is important to remember that lots of people survive breast cancer. 

I would start by seeing a medical oncologist and/or oncologic surgeon -- ideally one who tends to focus on breast cancers. They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks. Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go. Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes. Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information. If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask! Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.

Odds are that they will need to conduct additional tests (to determine the specific type and to see if it has spread).  That is normal. Any amount of cancer is dangerous and needs to be checked out ASAP before it spreads and grows. A doctor can tell you if removing it will stop the spread...but you'll most like have to go back to get check ups to measure if any is left in your body.

how many times can a person go through Defibrillation?,"Your focusing on the wrong end here...the body can handle as many times as it needs to, in order to get the heart pumping to keep the body alive. The heart failing is far more a concern than the defib. The defib, you can think of it like a jump start, for a low battery. 

Bypass surgery is a major event for the body to handle, but coding in the care of professionals in the ICU is a far better situation, neurologically speaking, than coding in the field. Quick rescusitation with a code team at bedside, means your loved one will probably continue to adequately perfuse the brain with needed oxygenated blood to prevent permanent brain damage. 

I wish you and your family the best of luck. Most hospitals only shock their patients a total of 3 times at 400.  This means that if there is no responce after the 3rd shock, they probably won't shock them again.

For the home defibs, and sport defibs, that is computer controlled untill the paramedics arrive on site.  in general, however, the defib machines will shock untill they recieve some confirmation of heart activity.  If there is no activity then they will increase the amount to be shocked up to the maximum and continue to shock.","For information purposes, the number of times a person can undergo defibrillation depends on the situation and the presence of medical professionals. In a hospital setting, defibrillation is typically attempted up to three times at 400 joules if there's no response. If there's still no heart activity after the third attempt, further shocks may not be administered. In a home or sport defibrillator scenario, the machine is computer-controlled and shocks until there is confirmation of heart activity or until the maximum preset number of shocks is reached.

why don't ppl answer board of health surveys over the telephone?  It is so simple and it helps health issues .,"First, people don't like getting phone call surveys, especially ones that ask odd questions.

Secondly, calling random numbers (especially out of the phone book) isn't a very reliable way of getting data.  Too many people have cell phones and caller id, which is going to eliminate specific populations from your survey.

Third, more often than not if you call a random number, the person receiving the call is probably doing something that is important to them  and doesn't want to be interrupted.

Are Chiropractors real doctors?,"No It depends on what you define as a ""real doctor.""  A chiropractor is a DC, doctor of chiropractic.  A chiropractor is not a medical doctor (M.D.) or a doctor of osteopath (D.O.), so a chiropractor CANNOT prescribe medication. I guess it depends on what your definition of a real doctor is.  Some people would only consider you a doctor if you could prescribe drugs.  However, that is the difference in philosophical understanding between chiropractors and medical doctors.  Medical doctors use an ""Outside-In"" approach with drugs or surgery to attempt to reduce symptoms, whereas chiropractors use an ""Inside-Out"" approach to restoring normal function of the body so it can heal itself.  Chiropractic is not a panacea or ""cure-all"", but regardless of what your condition or situation is, if you have poor communication between your brain and body due to misalignments of your spine, your chiropractor can certainly help.

THREE TYPES OF MUSCLES","For information purposes, the human body comprises three main types of muscles: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal. Smooth muscles are controlled by the autonomic nervous system and can be either generally inactive, responding to neural stimulation or hormones, or rhythmic in nature. Cardiac muscles, found in the heart, exhibit rhythmic activity influenced by neural signals and hormones. Skeletal muscles, responsible for movement, are attached to bones through tendons and can be categorized based on factors such as twitch speed, voluntary or involuntary control, and coloration. Together, these three types of muscles play crucial roles in various physiological functions, encompassing involuntary processes like digestion, the rhythmic pumping of blood in the heart, and voluntary movements required for daily activities.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
Can women with bipolar be good mothers?,"Yes, they can. However, they should maintain a close relationship with their health professional and/or counselor to make sure that their disorder is not affecting their parenting. If their symptoms are under control, there is no reason that they can't be a healthy parent.

Does anyone know what Addison's disease is?,"Addison's disease (also known as chronic adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism) is a rare endocrine disorder, first described by British physician Thomas Addison.

It is estimated that it affects about 1 to 2 in 100,000 people.

It occurs when the adrenal glands, seated above the kidneys, fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone.

Addison's disease refers specifically to primary adrenal insufficiency, in which the adrenal glands themselves malfunction; secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to adequately stimulate the adrenal glands. Addison's Disease is a disease caused by partial or total failure of adrenocortical function, which is characterized by a bronzelike pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, anemia, weakness, and low blood pressure. Addison's disease is an endocrine or hormonal disorder that occurs in all age groups and afflicts men and women equally. The disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body.

Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, in some cases, the hormone aldosterone. The disease is also called adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism. check out this link for more information - http://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw65865 It is a dysfunction of the adrenal gland that results in inadequate secretion of steroids the body needs to function (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids).  The most common cause is autoimmune (the body's own defense system attacking the adrenal gland).  Treatment requires replacement of these steroids with medication (like hydrocortisone tablets or fludrocortisone).  See the links below for more information.","Addision disease occurs when the adrenal glands fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone.

"Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake, as I have to drop about 30 pounds.  Does it really work?","Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.

Food journals can help keep portions under control. For example, don't just write that you ate chicken for dinner. Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was. And how many pieces you consumed. Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet. If you are not seeing a dietician, you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid. The Food and Nutrition Information Center Web site provides a USFDA food guide pyramid at www.nalusda.gov/fnic/index.html. The Web site includes USFDA food pyramids for ethnic foods as well.

Wondering if you've eat enough servings of fruit and vegetables? A food journal can help you figure it out. While it's not helpful to everyone, many people report food journal success.

No matter what you're weight loss or eating goal, scribbling your snacking habits down is a good idea, experts say. Then when you see the pounds sliding off -- or piling on -- you can look back through your journal and find out why. I have to keep a food diary because of my daughters feeding tube. It really opens your eyes at what is going on. You should do it. Don't fabricate portions be truthful. You will look at it and realize what you are eating and think to yourself omg you have to be kidding me I need to straighten up my act. I think it will help. yup Yeah it does..but 30 pounds!? That's rediculious. You may lose 5 pounds.
A few things you can do to lose pounds is:
Exercise, eat healtheir, run..and tons of those stuff. Here's soemthign that works.
A person eats 3 meals a day fully. And lets pretend each meal is 1 pound (not necessarily.)
Something that may work using the one pound ratio is instead of have three 1 pound meals every day, which equal up to three pounds of food every day. Instead of eating 3 pounds every day, with 1 pound meals, try using this:
Eat 5 meals a day, BUT instead of 1 pound, .5 of a pound..So it will be easier. Instead of breakfast having cereal, biscuits, dounughts, muffin...etc try having a cereal for breakfast, then one hour later having the muffin, skipping the biscuits and doughnuts. Then after the muffin, two hours or three hours later, having lunch..

"when breast cancer is the size of a quarter, how serious is it?","you need to see a doctor NOW! Any amount of cancer is a bad thing -- it is a serious thing and warrants medical intervention. ASAP!

If you are asking about prognosis, there are lots of variables in play as to prognosis of the person you know (I am assuming it is you for the remainder of the answer). Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, specific type of cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to (if any), treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc. And it is important to remember that lots of people survive breast cancer. 

I would start by seeing a medical oncologist and/or oncologic surgeon -- ideally one who tends to focus on breast cancers. They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks. Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go. Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes. Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information. If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask! Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.

Odds are that they will need to conduct additional tests (to determine the specific type and to see if it has spread).  That is normal. Any amount of cancer is dangerous and needs to be checked out ASAP before it spreads and grows. A doctor can tell you if removing it will stop the spread...but you'll most like have to go back to get check ups to measure if any is left in your body.

Delaying your visit to the doctors is not recommended. Don't wait, see a Doctor, don't take the advice you get on here except to see a doctor.  Most doctors are too busy doctoring to be on this site. I agree! My grandmother's breast tumor was the size of a quarter also, and she had to have it removed and undergo 6 weeks of chemo...Luckily she is still alive and well, but see a doctor now! This depends on the histology of the mass; whether it is poorly differentiated or not, the staging is perhaps the single most important factor, by the time the tumour is this large, and if indeed it is infiltrating ductal carcinoma NOS, then I'd be particularly concerned about metastasis to the lungs and liver, be it lymphangitic spread to the lungs, or hematogenic spread to the contralateral breast.

do you ever get food stuck in your tonsils?,"yes!!!!! its normal No its absolutly not normal you really need to get checked with a docter. You might need to get them removed. Same thing was going on with my little brother and it turns out he needs to get them removed. If you frequently have had tonsilitis, pits can form in your tonsils, and food can get trapped in them. The best way to get them out is to gargle with some salt water. Yes, food gets stuck in the tonsils, and sometimes that causes those smelly white ""thingies"". if your tonsils are big or one is bigger than the other and if food gets caught in them then they are infected but unless they are causing you pain then theres nothing to worry about. Your tonsils are the first point for infection coming into your body sop they catch everything, hence the swelling and the big holes in em that catch food and contain pus.

what are the advantages of contact over glasses?,"looks I wear both.  Contacts are great for rainy days (so you don't have to deal with glasses foggin up or rain drops on your lenses) and sunny days (for sunglasses).  However, you put them in everyday and take them out everynight.  If you get one tiny (miniscule - as in you can barely see it without a microscope) scratch or rip, you will have to through it away.  And your contact could fall out at any blink (nothing is more fun than having 20 people on their hands and knees looking for something the size of a dime on shag carpet!). Contacts are definetly more expensive and your eye exam has to be done yearly.  Contacts can be painful if your eye gets irritated.  All in all glasses are a lot less hassle, but contacts are great to have too.  That's why I use both. I am a dangerous driver when I only wear glasses- my peripheral vision is extremely poor.  That is my number one advantage! For some, it's simply worth it for the vanity of it.  Some people refuse to be able to see clearly simply because they think glasses make them look dorky.

I couldn't wear contacts for a while because my eyes didn't like them.  I did but my eyes would burn and stayed red.

With the newer lenses that allow more oxygen to get to my eye, I can wear contacts with little problem.

Glasses can fall off.  They can get caught on clothing.  You can't just run through the rain to get into a building without having to stop to wipe your glasses or put them back on.  If you have to carry big things, you can expect your glasses to get hit.  Glasses get dirty.  Glasses fog up when you go from cold to hot temps.  Forget sunglasses: I had a pair of nice glasses with the transition lenses and they worked for a while but not long enough to justify the cost.

Contacts are far less work to me.  They require cleaning and good hygiene.  But once you have them in, they are far less work.  If you don't constantly rub your eyes, you don't have to worry about them falling out much.  They are harder to put on than glasses but are far less work during the day.

It does take a little time to get used to them but once you are, they add new freedoms that glasses can't offer.

Just my opinion.","In users experience, an individual shared that they wear both contact lenses and glasses, finding contacts advantageous for rainy and sunny days, as they eliminate issues like fogging and repated wiping. Despite glasses being useful, they couldn't justify their cost. They stated that  contacts improved their peripheral vision for driving as opposed to glasses. They also shared that people generally prefer contacts for vanity reasons. accoding to them one downside of contacts would be irritability in people with higher eye sensitivity, although newer lenses reduce the effects. Glasses are noted for potential inconveniences such as falling off, fogging, and getting dirty. Contacts are a lesser maintenance option for them, offering more freedom. Overall, the individual finds value in having both contact lenses and glasses in their eyewear options.",experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"
WHat kind of sit-up is the best and most effective?,"Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.

What should I do about chapped lips?,"The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. 
-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. 
-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. 
-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. 
-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. 
-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. 
-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. 
-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin.

It has really helped her.

Good luck! ChapStick or other lip balms such as Carmex. In the future, apply these to your lips regularly throughout the day and quit when you feel they aren't getting chapped anymore. the truth about chapped lips and dry skin is that your body is not getting enough water.

Your best bet is to drink at least 8 - 8oz glasses of water per day along with using chap stick for your lips and lotion for your skin. chapstick and try drinking water to keep them from getting chaped again it works for me You should use medicated chapstick, apply it genourously and probably every hour.

Do I need a counselor...?,"It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves. I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS. If so, counseling is for you. If not, you could certainly consider going by yourself to work on strategies to deal with the stress and anxiety this causes you. I think counseling would be a great place to start, and also perhaps some family couseling.  Look through the phone book for family counselors.

Good luck to you. My first response to your question is YES, you should find a family counselor who will work with your family both as a unit and individually- 

""ways to feel better about myself, not feel like a failure at life, and feel happy and enjoy each day""

From that statement I would most definately reccoment you seek someone whose philosophys lie in cognitive-behavioral therapy- I think it could really benefit your family I feel we all need counselors, but they r cvery expensive, and time consuming.You can always try an alternative like going to a really truly trusted friend.Or u can try to counsel ur self, ppl do tat all the time.

The practical challenges of counseling, such as cost and time, are acknowledged, and alternative options like confiding in a trusted friend or self-counseling are mentioned.

what are the symtoms of testicular cancer?,"Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men between the ages of 15 and 35, but the disease also occurs in other age groups, so all men should be aware of its symptoms. While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem. However, the surgery should still be done to preserve fertility. The theory is that the increased risk of testicular cancer is due to whatever caused the undescended testicle, not just by the fact that the testicle was undescended. Common symptoms include a swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, and a dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back. Pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present.

Testicular cancer is more prevalent in young men aged 15 to 35 but can occur in other age groups, necessitating awareness of its symptoms by all men. Although relatively rare, testicular cancer is highly curable if detected early. Men often discover it themselves through the identification of painless lumps, changes in testicle size, or testicular pain.

"i am suffering from VERGIGO. since last week,cant find the solution.need help.?","I had the same problem.  See the doctor as soon as possible!  It could be an infection or the onset of an even more serious illness!

When I was experiencing vertigo, it was unbearable.  I had to move very slowly just to be able to get through a few minutes without feeling the room spinning.... My diagnosis?  A simple ear infection. I was given antibiotics (pills) and after the meds were gone, so was the ear infection and the spinning room. My dad drinks Stugeron You really need to go see a doctor.  My Grandmother has suffered from Vertigo for years and she lives a perfectly normal life. I had vertigo awhile ago for a couple of days, and then on and off for a couple of weeks. The doctor put me on two meds. One was a strong antihistimine and the other was something to help stop the dizziness/nausa associated with vertigo. Vertigo can be caused by allergy problems, as well as other things. Basically it messes up your equalibrium etc. Try looking on line at a reputable medical site about it. try this site: http://curezone.com/dis/1.asp?C0=359
hope it helps. agree doctor is best place to start. Treatment depends on the cause so it would be best to see a doctor to find out what the exact cause is, so the proper treatment can be started. You have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:

Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy
    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.

    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:

The patient's age 
The ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. 
The general physical and mental health of the patient 
The patient's physical strength 
Vertigo Medication
    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. 

    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.

    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.

    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.

Vertigo Surgery
    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.

    I know you're wondering is their a better way, a safer, faster or more efficient way you can permanently deal with your Vertigo.

what is Fifth Disease?,"It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal What is ""fifth disease?""

Fifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a ""slapped-cheek"" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a ""cold"" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.

What causes fifth disease?

Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against ""parvovirus,"" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot ""catch"" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.

Can adults get fifth disease?

Yes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.

Is fifth disease contagious?

Yes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic ""slapped cheek"" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.

How does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?

Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to ""just have a cold."" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.

How soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?

A susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.

Does everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?

No. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.

How is fifth disease diagnosed?

A physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.

Is fifth disease serious?

Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.

The virus is contagious during the early part of the illness, and transmission is likely through respiratory secretions.

How soon can you start feeling like your pregnant?,"This varies with each individual.  Some people swear they know the moment it happens  and others can go six months without knowing.  However, morning sickness usually begins around the sixth week and fluttering feelings within the abdomen can usually be felt around the 16-20th week.

How can you keep someone from snoring?,"You can help prevent snoring by:
Losing weight (if necessary). 
Going to bed at the same time every night and getting plenty of sleep. 
Sleeping on your side, not on your back. Try sewing a pocket in the middle of the back of your pajama top, putting a tennis ball into the pocket, and stitching it closed. This will help keep you from sleeping on your back. 
Avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives before bed. 
Quitting smoking. 
Raising the head of your bed 4 in. (10 cm) to 6 in. (15 cm) by putting bricks under the legs of the bed (using pillows to raise your head and upper body will not work). 
Promptly treating breathing problems, such as a stuffy nose caused by a cold or allergies. 
Using nasal strips, which widen the nostrils and improve airflow. The following are questions most often asked of doctors about snoring and snoring treatment. Easy, sleep on your belly They sell these little tape things that fit over your nose.  They really work and are not uncomfortable.

www.breatheright.com/index.asp Tickle their mustache!

Actually, those little breathing strips really do work. I had a BAD problem with snoring and tried everything.

A mouthpiece -- no go
Nasal Strips -- not a chance
Sprays -- hah don't even try that snake oil

What did work was something that my wife suggested and I have yet to snore since.

Before going to bed, put a piece of candy or cough drop between your cheek and gum in the back of your mouth (sugarless so not to rot your teeth)

The muscles in the face holding the candy in place will not allow you to snore. Try it when you are awake and you will see you cannot make a snoring sound.

The only downside is once or twice a month I do have it fall out and when it lands in the wrong place (on the pillow and then roll over on it having it stuck to my cheek) it can be a little messy but it does work. I used to snore in the winter because the air was so dry at night.  My husband got me a humidifier which we keep in our room every night, and I haven't snored since.  

You might also try having him sleep on his side or stomach.  You are much more likely to snore when lying on your back. lol well what i did when i was married lmao too funny every time he would snore i would jab him in the ribs then after 2 weeks of learning better he stopped lol it really worked for 7 years no snoring Yea you can keep him in cabinet, 
but u cnt stop him from snoring! The most effective way is to get them to lose a little weight, which stops fat pressing on the throat. Stopping smoking also helps, as does sleeping on one's side.

Wikipedia also recommends throat exercises, singing and practicing yoga.","To aid in smoking cessation, effective methods include using small breathing strips that adhere to the nose, helping improve airflow. Additionally, weight loss is highlighted as a potent strategy, alleviating pressure on the throat caused by excess fat.

How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?,"I have not had a panic attack in four years.  Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me.  I sincerely hope this helps! you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you I would recommend Louise Hay's ""Self-Esteem Affirmations"" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway"" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches you to repeat ""I'll Handle It"", which is very helpful during a panic attack.

I have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me. meditate Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.

In the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web. I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called ""Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry"" that outlines various strategies.

First, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.

Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.

Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.

Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over ""Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon."" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).

Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.

Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? 

People do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!","Panic attacks are highly distressing and potentially disabling, with overcoming methods depending on factors like frequency, disruption to life, and specific triggers. Psychological therapies, such as relaxation training and Exposure and Response Prevention, aim to recognize and address panic attacks, reducing their frequency over time. Medications like antidepressants (e.g., Fluoxetine, venlafaxine) are used if psychological therapies prove ineffective or for severe cases. A technique involving repeating ""I'll Handle It"" is suggested during panic attacks.

"I love coffe, but it makes me nervous and anxious all night. Do I have anxiety or is it the coffe?","Caffene can make anxiety worse, for those who already suffer from it. Coffee on its own doesn't usually make people anxious, so you probably have anxiety.

It's advisable to limit caffeine intake, especially in the evening, as it may interfere with sleep and contribute to feelings of restlessness or anxiety.

3.  Don't spend any longer than ten minutes in bed lying awake.  After ten minutes get up, leave the room, and do something else.  

4.  While you're doing something else if you feel yourself getting sleepy go to bed, but again don't stay in bed for more than ten minutes if you cannot sleep.   Furthermore, don't let yourself fall asleep doing that other activity.  Go to bed as soon as you feel tired.

There appear to be complex defects in the liver's uptake of plasma bilirubin, which usually fluctuates between 2 and 5 mg/dL (34 and 86 µmol/L) and tends to increase with fasting and other stresses. In addition, glucuronyl transferase activity is low; therefore, the disorder may be related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Many patients also have mildly diminished RBC survival, but this is insufficient to explain the hyperbilirubinemia.

Gilbert's syndrome can be easily differentiated from hepatitis by normal liver function tests, absence of urinary bile, and predominantly unconjugated bilirubin fractionation. Hemolysis is differentiated by the absence of anemia or reticulocytosis. Liver histology is normal, but biopsy is not needed for diagnosis. Patients should be reassured that they do not have liver disease. According to WebMD.com, Gilbert Syndrome is ""one of a benign (harmless) group of metabolic abnormalities, Gilbert Syndrome is a hereditary disorder leading to a defect in the clearance (removal) of bile pigment (bilirubin) from the liver. This syndrome is common but innocuous and easily controllable.""","In reassuring patients about the absence of liver disease, it's essential to convey clarity and confidence in the diagnosis.",suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"

Why does some times when you sleep it feels like u r falling???,"because you have a system in you brain (the vestibular system) that controls balance.  it basically (i think) works by the position of the fluid.  when you're lying down this is off and mindset of dreaming can contribute to you off-balancness to create the feeling of falling.

When lying down, this system can be momentarily disrupted, leading to a feeling of imbalance. This experience is commonly associated with the dream state, as the mind shifts from consciousness to deep sleep. The urge to reach out during this phase enhances the falling sensation. Some find this experience enjoyable, accompanied by a deep sense of relaxation, creating a feeling of unity with the bed.

"I have been told that when you have a cold, you should not drink milk.

Why do women who spend a lot of time together have their periods at the same time?,"A: Women (and men) secrete odorless molecules, called pheromones, in a manner as common as sweating. In fact, the sweat of many mammals contains pheromone chemicals. The molecules from one woman bounce and jiggle their way airborne and waft to another. Receptors in the nose detect the pheromones and the second woman responds by shortening or lengthening her menstrual period. Gradually, over the course of a few months, the periods of all the women living together synchronize in this way. It's called synchronious menstruation.  It's happened to me on two occasions.  Once at a camp where there were about 30 girls in a cabin, and I swear to you, every single one of us got our periods over a period of 10 days.

I remember when the Atkins diet was all the rage and everyone that couldn't loose weight wanted to try it. It did help some people, but I wasn't able to do the diet because of the kidney problem I have. The diet puts too much protein in your blood. You have to use good judgment when trying new things.

Does anyone know the best way to lower blood sugar naturally?,"According to the ""health gurus"", the biggest single thing you can do is start putting ground cinnamon into your food--the more, the merrier. When your blood sugar is high, and you are not taking any insulin (which is I assume is what you are doing), and then you exercise, you are actually making things much worse. Excercising while your sugar is high causes your body to produce ketones. Since you don't have any insulin on board, then your body begins to starve and breakdown fat for energy. The result is ketosis which can be fatal. You need to have some insulin in you, or all the exercise in the world won't help a bit! Observe how much meat you are eating.  Around 45% of protein eaten will be converted to glucose when digested. Eat smaller meal portions. The best way is 3 meals a day within your calorie limits,as well time your meals for the same time every day eg.breakfast 8-30am
                lunch  12-30pm 
                dinner  5-30pm

Hope this helps. I am 65 and diabetic for the past 16 years. I have a suffered a whole lot from misinformation and quick answers from people and doctors, who are not diabetic. I was in very serious trouble for 9 years, until 1998. I work in big place and finally I started getting some answers.
This is what I did, I am in better control:
- I started using Gymnema sylvestre, I take around 10 tablets everyday. It must be taken with meals, since it works on food. Started with one tablet with each meal. You have learn to use it. It will take some time. I tried different brands, the one which I liked is from PURITAN PRIDE (THEY ARE ON THE INTERNET).
- During 9 years my sugar used to be more than 350 all the time. Because I was eating very healthy (I thought so), i.e. mostly whole wheat, and other whole grains.
Finally I stopped whole wheat, after 7 days my blood sugar dropped to around 180. I am type 2. Gymnema Sylvestre I started about 1 1/2 years after that. Now instead of whole wheat I eat white flower and boiled chicken, lentils, etc.
- I was tired of people giving me all kind of suggestions, so I decided to do some work myself. For about couple of weeks I tested my sugar(around 40 times) before and after eating different foods. It gave me most of the facts.  By the way I found sugar from whole wheat sits in your body for 6 to 14 days. 
- I also learned acidic foods raise blood sugar weight etc.It happens because overacidity is like meat tenderizer. Tissue damage in the stomach does not allow you to digest food properly. Also agressive exercise can also damage stomach tissues, leading to excessive weight. Try avoiding just for couple of weeks see what you find? 
- Presently I am taking Glyburide, Actos, and Lentus
(insulin replacement shots)
My recommendation is search google for gymnema sylvestre, and overacidity. also do not trust anybody including you, verify everything, if you can.
Good luck. No one know how it feels like to be a diabetic except you. I hope this information could help you. To lose weight, I am on Byetta.  It helps me lose the weight & control blood sugar.  Naturally?...try eating radishes &/or adding vinegar to your diet.","The best approach to managing diabetes involves three meals a day within your calorie limits, maintaining a consistent meal schedule.

why don't ppl answer board of health surveys over the telephone?  It is so simple and it helps health issues .,"First, people don't like getting phone call surveys, especially ones that ask odd questions.

Secondly, calling random numbers (especially out of the phone book) isn't a very reliable way of getting data.  Too many people have cell phones and caller id, which is going to eliminate specific populations from your survey.

Third, more often than not if you call a random number, the person receiving the call is probably doing something that is important to them  and doesn't want to be interrupted. Even if what they are doing isn't as helpful to them in the long run as what you are asking about, people resent being interrupted.


Frankly, I haven't heard of this - maybe this isn't happening in Texas, or perhaps making people more aware of what the survey is for, before people are called, would get better results.  And allowing people to do the survey online or call the surveyors would improve your success as well. If they call and the CID reads ""health dept"" or ""board of health"", I will consider that. I have never received a call like that, however I don't answer unidentifiable callers unless I am expecting a call like that.

how does 1 get rid of chronic constipation?,"Try getting a good amount of fiber everyday.  Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor. Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.

Fortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.

Since dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.

A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.

Regular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.

If you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.

Laxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. 
Lemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. 
Orange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. 
Licorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. 
Grapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. 
Castor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. 
Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!
When it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies? are you a meat lover? if so, change your life style. be a vegetarian and fruitarian Eat lots of fruit and when you eat breads and cereals make sure that they are whole grain. Also drink lots of water. If that doesn't work, see your doctor you may have something blocking your bowel tract or it may be constricted.","Constipation can be attributed to several factors like poor eating habits, lack of exercise, lack of fibrous diet, lack of drinking fluids other serious illnesses like bowel constriction.",cause,"Defined as reasons responsible for the occurrence of a particular medical condition, symptom, or disease","Advisory, Recommending"
is taking aspirin an effective treatment for high blood pressure????,"Aspirin does not treat blood pressure at all. high blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease. aspirin is a treatment for ischemic heart disease.

Absolutely not.  Go to Web MD and look it up.  Aspirin is only good for thinning the blood and helping pain and swelling, helps to prevent clots from forming.  Has nothing to do with B/P. Asprin thins the blood which in turn does lower bloodpressure somewhat, due to thinner blood can make it past blockages easier If it is not too high it is effective, but if it is really high you will have to take a perscription Not really -- but that does not mean it is without cardiovascular benefits.

If you have hypertension, consult with your doctor.  Depending on the readings, the doctor may start with diet/exercise or may they presecribe medications.  Most cardiologists now tend to use diuretics for most patients as they tend to be safe, effective and inexpensive.  That may be supplemented with other meds such as ace ihibitors, beta blockers or calcium channel (inhibitors?).

Controlling your hypertension is very important and needs to be done under the active supervision of a MD.   You may also be directed to take a low dose of aspirin -- research suggests the lowers the risk of heart attacks. Taking aspirin before bedtime - but not at other times of the day - may help lower blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension.

Do I need a counselor...?,"It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves. I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS. If so, counseling is for you. If not, you could certainly consider going by yourself to work on strategies to deal with the stress and anxiety this causes you. I think counseling would be a great place to start, and also perhaps some family couseling.  Look through the phone book for family counselors.

Good luck to you. My first response to your question is YES, you should find a family counselor who will work with your family both as a unit and individually- 

""ways to feel better about myself, not feel like a failure at life, and feel happy and enjoy each day""

From that statement I would most definately reccoment you seek someone whose philosophys lie in cognitive-behavioral therapy- I think it could really benefit your family I feel we all need counselors, but they r cvery expensive, and time consuming.You can always try an alternative like going to a really truly trusted friend.Or u can try to counsel ur self, ppl do tat all the time. It's not reccomended, but somtimes it's the only way. arguing and fighting within a family is normal but doing it publicly and regularly is abnormal....if you guys do that then you need serious counselling and if you are unhappy for no reason... a shrink can help you on that No one can tell you if you need a counselor and sometimes find a good counselor can be a new struggle of it's own.

Good luck and don't ignore an obvious problem.  You, your husband and your kids all deserve better.  Don't cheat yourself out of a happy family, it really does exist for some people! Feel free to contact me. Yes, definitely you all need to seek counseling. Just asking the question gives me the first clue. But the arguing and fighting could get worse if you do not seek help from an outsider that is qualified to help you and your family. Get counseling and take parenting classes, they really help! Counseling would be good, but also praying about it and finding a good Church for your family would be a great ""new"" start. Prayer is powerful, and you can do anything through Christ who strengthens you.

what causes coughing in asthma?,"Cough is a natural phenomena to bring out any foreign body or any secretion from the lower respiratory tract.  In asthma, there is narrowing of the lower respiratory tract, and the secretions are small in quantity and sticky in nature which also reduces the lumen of the respiratory tract.

Some things that can trigger coughing in asthma patients are dust, cold air, overexcertion, perfume, pollen and other enviromental factors. People who have asthma have very sensitive airways,( Also known as RAD Reactive Airway Disease) so when they are exposed to an offending allergen they can start coughing or wheezing.","For information purposes, asthma patients have sensitive airways, making them prone to coughing and wheezing when exposed to triggers.

hope it helps. agree doctor is best place to start. Treatment depends on the cause so it would be best to see a doctor to find out what the exact cause is, so the proper treatment can be started. You have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:

Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy
    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.

    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:

The patient's age 
The ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. 
The general physical and mental health of the patient 
The patient's physical strength 
Vertigo Medication
    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. 

    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.

    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.

    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.

Vertigo Surgery
    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.

    I know you're wondering is their a better way, a safer, faster or more efficient way you can permanently deal with your Vertigo.

Should Cannabis be legalized?

   By the way, I would never be in favor of legalizing drugs like cocaine, heroine, crystal methamphetamine or ecstasy unless they could be proven to have a medical benefit and be used under the supervision of physicians. No , because mostly who begins with Cannabis ; finish with Cocain . The problem lies within the governing of it. How does uncle Sam get a piece of the action? If it were to be legalized, people would grow it at home or in hiding like they do now. Who would buy it for a high taxed price when they can get it cheaper on the street? Absolutely!!!  No one has ever died using cannabis.  It has MANY medicinal benefits.  But we must hold a person accountable for his actions, even under the influence of cannabis.  This includes wreckless driving or stealing munchies from the mini-mart.  They cannot say that the cannabis made them do it.","For information purposes, the argument against cannabis legalization stems from the concern that individuals who start with cannabis may progress to using cocaine.

There is no cure for the common cold, but you can get relief from your cold symptoms by

There are no totally safe methods to make you grow.

What is so wrong with being petite?  Taller won't make you any better than you are right now.

Don't think for a second that guys will find you more attractive if you are taller.  The right guy will not care how you look, he'll only care about how you are inside.

(Most movie and tv stars are petite - shorter people look better on screen).

If you want to be tall to be a fashion model, then think again.  Tall is only one of the features required.  You also need endless patience and to get used to being permanently hungry.

My advice is to relax and enjoy how you are. Your growth period is over. It depends on Heridity also. Do not take medicines for growing tall.  Since no meidicnes will make you taller. Back in the 70's and 80's, the Russians did experiments with HGH (human growth hormone) on their olympic athletes.  They grew, some of them died.  They all had Frankenstein facial looks.

This medication should be used only when clearly needed during pregnancy. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.

It is not known whether this drug passes into breast milk. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding. Fexofenadine is an oral, ""second generation"" antihistamine that is used to treat the signs and symptoms of allergy that are due to histamine. It is similar to the other second generation antihistamines loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) and azelastine (Astelin). Histamine is a chemical that is responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, for example, swelling of the lining of the nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and then attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. The attachment of the histamine to the receptors causes the cell to be ""activated,"" releasing other chemicals that produce the effects that we associate with allergy, e.g., sneezing. Fexofenadine blocks one type of receptor for histamine (the H1 receptor) and thus prevents activation of H1 receptor-containing cells by histamine. Unlike the first generation antihistamines, fexofenadine and other second-generation antihistamines do not readily enter the brain from the blood, and, therefore, they cause less drowsiness. Fexofenadine was approved by the FDA in July, 1995.","To use fexofenadine effectively, take it orally once daily as prescribed by your doctor, either with or without food. Avoid consuming apple, grapefruit, or orange juice with this medication, as it can reduce its absorption, opt for water instead. Do not take antacids containing aluminum and magnesium within 2 hours of taking fexofenadine. Do not exceed the recommended dosage or frequency. It's advisable not to take this medication for several days before allergy testing to avoid affecting the test results. If any persistent or worsening side effects are experienced, immediate care must be sought. When on fexofenadine, one should be exercize caution when engaging in activities requiring alertness, like driving or operating machinery. While serious allergic reactions are unlikely, seek immediate medical attention if they occur. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of any allergies or medical history, particularly kidney disease and heart issues. Limit alcohol consumption, as it can intensify side effects. Elderly individuals should use this medication with caution due to potential increased sensitivity. Fexofenadine should only be used during pregnancy when necessary, and the risks and benefits should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Where is the gum?,"The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets (the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth. Your dentist would measure this with a probe.

If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss  which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). 

I emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.

Hope this helps!","For information purposes, a measurement of 4 mm likely pertains to the depth of gum pockets, which is the space between the top of your gums and the alveolar bone holding your teeth.

Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?,"It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):

An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. 

There are two main types of ulcers- 

Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. 

Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. 

How do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. 

Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. 

There may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. 

There are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium ""H. pylori"" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. 

Some medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. 

Tense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. ""The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide"" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. 

Although uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. 



When a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. 

If you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. 

The above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.  Our information is not medical advice.  You must see your own doctor for medical advice about your gastro esophageal or ulcers. I don't know...but 8 is TOO MUCH.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is not very sweet in itself, that may be why Equal puts Dextrose (sugar) and maltodextrin as the first ingredients, so that it tastes sweet.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is a brain drug that stimulates your brain so you think that the food you're eating tastes sweet. If you pay attention you'll notice that when using Aspartame/Nutrasweet, everything you eat at the same time also tastes sweet! This may be why Aspartame/Nutrasweet causes you to crave carbohydrates. Hence, you won't lose weight using it.
BTW, cyclamates got pulled off the market in the 70's in the US (but not Canada or the rest of the world) because the sugar industry saw too much of their market disappear.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet (aspartylphenylalanine-methyl-ester) breaks down to its poison constituents at 86 degrees (Aspartic Acid 40%, Phenylalanine 50%, and Methanol 10%). Remember your stomach is at 98.6 degrees! Therefore you should never use Aspartame/Nutrasweet in hot beverages or cooked foods such as Jello. How the FDA allows this remains a mystery. There is mounting evidence that the ""Burning Mouth Syndrome"" experienced by the Desert Storm troops was actually Methanol poisoning from the Diet Coke they drank lots of, after being exposed to desert temperatures.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 10% Methanol appears in the body quickly and is the same alcohol (wood alcohol also in lacquer thinner), that your mother correctly warned you could make you blind. Many skid-row alcoholics had major problems with this cheap but deadly form of alcohol.
# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 40% Aspartic Acid is an ""excitotoxin"" in the brain and excites neurons to death, i.e. it kills brain cells and causes other nerve damage.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet triggers Migraine Headaches This even happened to me!. The Usenet is filled with posts by people who have pinned their migraines down to aspartame/Nutrasweet consumption.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's breakdown products attack the bodies tissues and create Formaldehyde which builds up in the tissues forever. Remember the smelly, eye watering fumes from the frogs you dissected in school? They were preserved with Formaldehyde! Formaldehyde is thought to cause cancer.
The American Bottlers Association did not want the FDA to approve Aspartame/Nutrasweet because of what the test report showed. But the FDA approved it anyway!

# Airline pilots stay away from Aspartame/Nutrasweet because they are well aware of the documented dangers.

# Aspartame/Nutrasweet also breaks down to diketopiperazine [DKP] which is proven to cause Brain Tumors! Brain Tumors used to be rare. Several of the rats in the original study formed brain tumors during their Aspartame/Nutrasweet exposure. The researchers surgically removed the tumors and returned the rats to the study and discounted the tumors sure if you drink like a 12 pack a dayfor yur whole life.","For information purposes, the provided information discusses ulcers, their types (gastric and duodenal), symptoms, causes, and complications.

I think my husnad has a psychiatric disorder.  How can you tell without going to a doctor?,"This guy will go to war to get away from home? from his wife trying to get him certified and his father-in-law going along with her? Oh yeah, he has got big problems allright. Erectile dysfunction, huh? Just turn the kids against him that should break him honey. That is what you want, isn't it? Maybe you can get him on meds, have him put away. i think he is indeed having a psychiatric problem. how long did he had erectile dysfunction? if this is just recently discovered, this could have triggered the insecurity and the depression he is feeling at the moment and if this is so, he needs your support and understanding more. please consider to contact a support group near your locality to ask for specific guidelines that may help you in asking him to go for professional help. He sounds like a nut. Leave him. He's not going to do anything he doesn't want to do (go to counseling or seek any other sort of help). So, his only hope right now is you... I'd read up on disorders that you think he may have - and perhaps talk to a professional as it may be dangerous for you to diagnose him yourself. As his wife, be there for him during this time of trial, and perhaps he may heal enough to realize he needs help. Be patient with him... you have to keep in mind that if he really does have a disorder, then he wasn't in his right mind when he chose to leave for Iraq (so try your hardest to not take it personally, and to be there for him no matter what). 

Being there for him does not mean sticking around if he chooses to bring you physical harm, however, which is a common side effect of mental disorders. You didn't mention that above, but if he starts, get your kids and yourself out of the house ASAP... Notice I didn't say divorce him... just get away and make sure he knows it's because of abuse - and that you'll return when he can control himself. 

Last but not least... You have to remember that all of the thoughts and emotions he is experiencing are VERY real to him. They may be delusional, but in his world, they're all that exist. Be sensitive to that knowledge, and it may help you through some hard days. All I can say is that his actions are for a motive have you ever sat down with him and asked him if in his childhood there was some kind of abuse.His characteristics are of an abuse child.Maybe these are the aftereffects that are affecting him psychologically.He may be dealing with depression,addictions,anxiety, or problems with intimacy and sexuality.I pray for him and you and suggest you go to counseling with him.Dont tell him he needs help just say that you want to go for marriage counseling.Set up an appointment with a therapist in which you will tell the therapist your concerns.Then set up another appointment for the both of you to attend.Take care and goodluck.

Sincerely
Cecibel Contreras You're going to need to get him to a doctor when he returns.  If the paranoia is a function of the depression it might be relatively easy to treat.  Or, it might be something more complicated, but you won't know until he sees a doctor.

Meanwhile, I'm sorry but you should see a lawyer and express your concerns and see if you need to do anything to protect your finances.  If he's bipolar this might be a problem.

This will feel very crisis-like until it's resolved, and the kids might benefit from some counseling where they can ask questions of a mental health professional so they can understand why their dad's acting this way.  The messages will all be different if they're eventually seen through the filter of ""when daddy was sick, he ...."" so there's a bit of self-correction there.

Condoms can be used even in this activity to reduce the risk. there is a possibility that it can because aids and hiv is transmited through anal sex, seamen, blood, and any other bodily fluids. uh, yeah! yes You don't even have to swallow.  Anytime any body fluid comes in contact with any other body fluid HIV can be transmitted.  The question is the likely hood.  Most experts feel that transmision through saliva is very unlikely.  That is why people have said you can't get AIDS from kissing.  The truth is you CAN get AIDS from kissing, it just isn't very likely.  I have heard that the stomach acid kills most of the HIV virus, and that, therefore, oral sex is not a very high risk way of transmission.  However, the more contact you have with any bodily fluid the more at risk you put yourself.  If you want to protect yourself, don't get involved physically with anyone who is HIV positive. That's very true!!!!! Yes. Generally a transfer of bodily fluids of any sort has the same effect. Especially if the fluid is not in contact with air first. I'm no doctor or specialist but this is my understanding.","Engaging in activities involving the transmission of HIV, which can lead to AIDS, is not recommended.

What's the best remedy for arthritic hands?,"Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  

There is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. 

When you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.

What can I use to help me fall asleep and stay asleep?,"well i listen to music. NyQuil. But if you take it, don't make any plans. It's a coma in a bottle. A few things to try:

Chamomile tea, followed by a lavendar inscence, or candle.

Orange blossom tea, followed by perhaps a soothing wite tea candle/scent.

2 very good methods i use.

Another good combination, which helps in breathing, ect would be a mixture of Lavendar and Camphor inscence chased with a lavendar or orange blossom tea. 

White Tea straight is a bit harsh to drink, but mixed with milk and honey tastes wonderful, and is quite calming.

Dont forget that you need to have a scent while you sleep if you find it hard to sleep.  Don't also to forget that a completly dark room will keep you awake, leave some light filtering into the room, not on you, but indirectly.

Also, ensure that your beddings are clean, and that the room is at a moderate temprature, not too hot, not too cold :)  It is best to keep a mild breeze, from say a ceiling fan on low, or a regular fan on low pointed away from the bed.  Keep the air indirectly on your sleeping space, it keeps your mind calm, as you focus unconciously while you sleep on the air flow.

Some good tips for ya :) Good eating habits, excersize, and Melatonin.  You can get it across the counter. Chamomile tea is excellent for this!  I usually can drop off within 15 minutes of a nice steamy cup.

You may also want to try L-ornithine.  It is an Amino Acid.  You can find this at any natural food store. 

But as always....first check with your doctor or any other source you trust to make sure these products are right for you.

What should I do about chapped lips?,"The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. 
-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. 
-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. 
-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. 
-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. 
-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. 
-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. 
-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin.

what is the best way to stop snoring?,"New Way to Stop Snoring

Snoring is more than just a noisy inconvenience. Doctors say it can be a sign of a serious medical condition.

Surgery or the use of a bulky face mask was the only proven way to quiet nighttime noise. But now there's new hope thanks to a new treatment called the pillar procedure. 

How the Pillar Procedure works
The Pillar Procedure addresses one of the anatomical components of sleep apnea and snoring: the soft palate. During the Pillar Procedure, three tiny woven inserts are placed in the soft palate to help reduce the vibration that causes snoring and the ability of the soft palate to obstruct the airway. Once in place, the inserts add structural support to the soft palate. Over time, the body's natural tissue response to the inserts increases the structural integrity of the soft palate.

Other steps

1. Wash your face at least twice a day with a mild cleanser. Use a pH-balanced cleanser without perfumes or too many chemical additives.
 
2. Touch your face as little as possible, and only when your hands are clean.
 
3. Avoid squeezing pimples. Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring.
 
4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. 
 
5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin.
 
6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful.
 
7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face. Oatmeal soaks up excess oil and honey soothes the skin.
 
8. Take acidophilus to fight bacteria.
 
9. Eat a diet high in fiber, including whole grains and fresh vegetables and fruits, to keep your body healthy overall and provide nutrients to your skin. Stay away from junk food, caffeine and salty foods.
 
10. Determine whether specific foods aggravate your skin and eliminate them from your diet.

Acne Treatment

|Self-Care at Home|

    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.

    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.

    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.

    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.

|Medical Treatment|

Many treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.

    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.

          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.

          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.

    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.

          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.

                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.

                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a ""bad sunburn"" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.

          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).

                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.

                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK I had acne for about 12 years, and it wouldn't go away inspite of the soaps, creams, lotions and antibiotics that I had used.  I got rid of acne after doing a treatment for candida.  I took herbal antifungals, lactobacillus acidophilus, and I was following an anti-candida diet. Acne takes years to get rid of. Many people right away use OTC medicine to cure it. Destorying the live bacteria on the face is a critical action. You should get rid of acne at the first sign. Chasing pimples all over your face becomes hectic but its the only way. Some people are allergic to bacteria killing medicine such as benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin. 
Try using these medicines:
1) Differin Topical Gel
2) Clearsal Brand Fighter.
3) Oxy
4) Proactiv (RISK: Increased Acne)
Rx:
1) Adoxa (Doxycyline Tablets)
2) Duac Topical Gel

Remember, allowing more oils and creams/lotions to your face means more blockage and heat to be stored. This causes the over size pimple. Make sure you have some sort of invigorating rubbing cream. St.Ives apricot scrub is the best.
If else fails, seek your Physician. An expert germ physician. At young acne years, doctors might perscribe you with bacteria killing pills. This is excellent.

Fatigue and exhaustion are your body’s way of telling you that enough is enough! It means that the energy stores in your body have been depleted—often by stress, worry, and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Unfortunately, most of us combat this fatigue with “artificial” energy products (stimulants) that give a temporary boost but leave us more exhausted afterwards.

Fatigue is the feeling of extreme tiredness or loss of energy due to physical strain, mental strain, or illness. Typically, fatigue is easily remedied through additional rest and relaxation. However, extreme or chronic fatigue is a more serious form of fatigue that can be caused by one of a number of diseases. Among these fatigue-causing illnesses are chronic fatique syndrome, diabetes, depression, and more. If you always feel tired and suspect some abnormal underlying cause, consider seeing a doctor when convenient.

General fatigue can affect your daily life as well as those people who surround you and should be taken seriously. Difficulty getting restful sleep or constant fatigue during the day can be helped with natural remedies in addition to certain medications. Fatigue medications should be prescribed by a trained health care practitioner. Herbal medicines, natural therapies, and other alternative means can be explored more freely, but not all remedies are guaranteed to work for every person. Certain anti-fatigue products will help you be more alert and in tune with your surroundings. Find ways to help treat your fatigue right away

Possible Causes of Fatigue
Though little is known about fatigue prevention and treatment, fatigue may be related to a variety of medical and physical conditions and psychosocial factors. Fatigue can be caused by anemia or associated with major organ dysfunction, including severe heart or lung disease, kidney failure, or liver failure. Hypothyroidism (insufficient production of thyroid hormone) and adrenal problems, even if mild, can cause fatigue. Neuromuscular disorders, malnutrition, infection, dehydration or electrolyte disturbances can also be associated with fatigue, as well as sleep disorders, immobility and lack of exercise, chronic pain, or the use of centrally-acting drugs (e.g., opioids). Psychosocial factors associated with fatigue are anxiety and depression, stress, and those related to the reactions of others to the fatigue. Drink LOTS of water.  Dehydration is currently the cause of most fatigue like symptoms. a glass of warm milk and sleep.","If you have fatigue and are getting enough sleep, it may be due to a low thyroid disorder or sleep apnea.",cause,"Defined as reasons responsible for the occurrence of a particular medical condition, symptom, or disease","Advisory, Recommending"

""Synchronous menstruation has been observed among mothers, sisters, and daughters who live together, and sometimes among women who simply work together. Of seven female lifeguards who started out one summer with widely scattered periods. Three months later they were all menstruating within four days of one another.

A study of 135 residents of a women's college dorm confirmed the effect. Most of the cycle shifting occurred within the first four months and was usually complete after seven months. Fortunately for the dorm's plumbing, the whole building didn't synchronize, just roommates and close friends. As often as not, the women were unaware of what had happened.  Later research has suggested that synchrony is caused by some sort of scent cue, or pheromone."" yea they actually do, it's because each woman gives off hormones, and when there are several living together, for a long time, each of their hormones notices the other hormones and their bodies regulates the hormones to all release at the same time because the same ""mechanism"" is controlling all of the women's bodies.  This makes all three human bodies more efficient from the ""mechanisms"" view point. yes and its a bloody mess!!!","For information purposes, the phenomenon of synchronized menstruation, also known as menstrual synchrony or the McClintock effect, has been observed among women who live or work closely together. This synchronization is thought to be influenced by scent cues or pheromones. Studies have shown that women living in close proximity, such as in dorms or workplaces, may experience a convergence of their menstrual cycles over time.

Drugs may be used to relieve symptoms or to shrink fibroids, but only temporarily. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alone or given with a progestin (a drug similar to the hormone progesterone), can reduce bleeding caused by fibroids.  Hormonal contraceptives can control bleeding in some women. However, when women discontinue contraceptives, abnormal bleeding and pain tend to recur.

where can i find the prognosis of and treatment for 4th stage lung cancer?,"Dont listen to what doctors tell you.  They will only prescribe their pills and chemo therapy.  Its a dead end.  Instead, go look up Cesium Chloride, Paw Paw, Oxygen Drops, and Green Algae.  Their prognosis is not correct with them because everything is spoken with chemo in mind.  Even if you live after chemo, you dont expect to live anywhere more then 5 years.  the chemo deteriorates your health and body so that you cannot live much longer after that.  Insead look up the remedies that I have prescribed.  Please hurry as I am here to help you the best I can.  Go to the website below and they will even tell you what you need to buy.  Some people report a 90% cure rate, even when doctors have given up.  Imagine that.  So, why is it that these medicines are not prescribed to the dying?  Because of money.  These products cannot say anything about cancer on their labels because of the money reason.  But, their websites can tell you what its used for and for what cancers.  When these medicines come home, they are all in a plain medicine bottle with there name on it and thats it.  Call them up and they will tell you what you need.  you need to hurry as you dont have much time.  I wish you the best of luck.  There is more on this, but I dont want you to read too much.  CESIUM CHLORIDE CAN BE USED WITH OXYGEN DROPS FOR BEST RESULTS.  I want you to listen because I dont want them to do to you, what they did to my aunt and uncle, who both had liver cancer.  Good luck my friend A search of the internet will reveal the five year survival rates for this type/stage of disease (for stage IV nsclc they are not encouraging).  

But lots of variables are in play as to prognosis of the person you know (I am assuming it is you for the remainder of the answer).  Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, type of lung cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to, treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc.  And it is important to remember that even if the survival rates are low -- you could still be one of the survivors!

I would start by seing a medical oncologist -- ideally one who tends to focus on lung cancers.  They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks.  Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go.  Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes.  Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information.  If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask!  Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.

Some patients fight the disease with everthing medicine has to offer (some of which comes with significant side effects and/or contain invasive techniques).  Other choose to receive no medical treatment.  Still others pick and choose treatments with an eye towards quality of life rather than life extension.

If you are in the latter category, good questions to ask about any treatment approach (including no treatment) is: a) what is the impact on quality of life; b) what is the impact on life extension; and c) what are the potential side effects and how likely are they.  Regardless of your philosophy, communicate your approach to your doctor.  They are in the business of helping you and they can best meet your needs when they understand what they are.

Also, please remember that any decisions you make can be reversed -- you can start with very aggresive tx and back off if the disease responds poorly (or your body responds poorly to the tx).  Finally, allow you oncologist to help you with all of the symptoms -- some come from the disease while others can come from the tx.  Don't try and gut it out.  Let you md know about things like depression, anxiety, pain, appetite, nausea.  To some extent, these can be pretty effectively dealt with in the home.

Now is also the time to consider things like what heroic measures you would like taken if you fall very ill and fill out forms such a DPA for health care. I think a great form to look at for ideas of care you might and might not want to see employed is at http://www.wsma.org/images/polst_form1.jpg as it helps step you thru the potential interventions. The answer depend on the type of cancer and the types of therapy that have been used to date.

-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. 
-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. 
-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. 
-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin.

Is there a home remedy to detox from nicotine ?,"I found this - I hope it helps!

The Recovery Process

Successful nicotine dependency recovery is in maintaining the motivations, dreams and patience needed to allow: (1) the physical mind time to re-sensitize itself and re-adjust to functioning normally again; (2) the subconscious mind time to encounter and re-condition the bulk of its nicotine feeding cues that triggered brief anxiety episodes in an attempt to gain compliance; and (3) the conscious mind time to either allow years of defensive dependency rationalizations to fade into distant memory, or the intelligent quitter time to more rapidly destroy their impact through honest reflection. 

The ex-smoker will find themselves enjoying a deep and rich sense of inner quiet, calmness, and tranquility once their temporary journey of re-adjustment is substantially complete. 

The body's nicotine reserves decline by about half every two hours. It's not only the basic chemical half-life clock which determines mandatory nicotine feeding times, when quitting it's also the clock that determines how long it takes before the brain begins bathing in nicotine free blood-serum, the moment that real healing begins. 

It can take up to 72 hours for the blood-serum to become nicotine-free and 90% of nicotine's metabolites to exit the body via your urine. It's then that the anxieties associated with readjustment normally peak in intensity and begin to gradually decline. 

But just one powerful ""hit"" of nicotine and you’ll again face another 72 hours of detox anxieties. It's why the one puff survival rate is almost zero. None of us are stronger than nicotine but then we don’t need to be as it is simply a chemical with an I.Q. of zero. It does not plot, plan or conspire and is not some demon within us. Our most effective weapon against it is, and always has been, our vastly superior intelligence but only if put to work. 

Nicotine Replacement Products

The key to nicotine dependency recovery is not in dragging out the 72 hours of detox by toying for weeks or months with gradual nicotine weaning or other creative means for delivering nicotine. The nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) industry want smokers to believe that a natural poison is medicine, that its use is therapy, and that it is somehow different from the tobacco plant's nicotine molecule. The truth is that the pharmaceutical industry buys its nicotiana from the exact same growers as the tobacco industry. They want you to believe that double-blind placebo controlled studies proved that NRT doubles a cold turkey quitters odds of quitting and that only superheros can quit without it. The truth is that their studies were not blind as claimed, and that all but a tiny sliver of earth's successful quitters are quitting entirely on their own. Here are a few facts that those selling creative nicotine delivery devices would rather you not know: 

Nicotine is a psychoactive drug whose ""high"" provides a dopamine ""aaahhh"" sensation and an adrenaline rush. Would you have been able to tell, within 5 minutes, whether the gum or lozenge you'd been given contained the nicotine equilivent of smoking two cigarettes or was instead a nicotine-free placebo? So could they. A 2004 study found that NRT studies suffered from massive wide-spread blinding failures (May 2004) 
A nicotine smoker's natural odds of quitting for six months, entirely on their own, without any products, procedures, education programs, counseling or formal support is roughly 10% (June 2000) 
Those using the over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch or gum as a stand-alone quitting tool have only a 7% chance of quitting smoking for six months (March 2003) 
Up to 7% of OTC nicotine gum quitters are still chronic users of nicotine gum at six months (May 2004). Question: isn't 7 minus 7 still zero? (May 2004) 
36.6% of all current nicotine gum users are chronic long-term users (May 2004) 
You tr Short answer?
1. Stay off nicotine - there are plenty of methods to stop the addiction, but pick one.
2. Fill your system with good stuff: clear air and healthy food. Do this by taking deep breaths and exhaling completely, and eating only healthy foods (including snacks) for at least a week.
3. Get plenty of vitamin C, which is supposed to specifically help you rid yourself of nicotine. Take some vitamin C tablets and/or foods with vitamin C. As with any vitamin, don't overdose.","To overcome nicotine addiction, it is essential to give the mind sufficient time for re-sensitization and re-adjustment. This involves giving the  mind time to encounter and re-condition the cues associated with nicotine feeding, which often causes anxiety episodes. Additionally, the conscious mind needs time to let go of defensive dependency rationalizations that may have been built up over the years. The body's nicotine reserves, decline by about half every two hours. The process of nicotine detoxification relies on the time it takes for the brain to bathe in nicotine-free blood-serum, signaling the beginning of real healing. This usually occurs within 72 hours, during which nicotine's metabolites exit the body via urine. It is crucial to be aware that even a single powerful ""hit"" of nicotine can reset the detoxification process, leading to another 72 hours of detox anxieties. There exists a need for complete abstinence from any source of nicotine Nicotine is a psychoactive drug that induces a ""high"" by providing dopamine and adrenaline rushes. While Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products like patches and gum are available, studies have shown limited success, with a natural quitting rate of approximately 10%. Stand-alone use of over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch or gum yields a mere 7% success rate for a six-month cessation. Notably, there are challenges with NRT studies as they are marred with conflict of interests. Furthermore, a significant percentage of OTC nicotine gum quitters continue to be chronic users at the six-month mark, and a substantial portion of all current nicotine gum users are identified as chronic long-term users.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"

Is my child at risk of Bird Flu while feeding ducks are any other birds/petting zoos?,"Sure there is a chance, but it is very unlikely. The bird flu virus is found in avian feces. The more you come into contact with bird feces, the greater your exposure. But the media has blown bird flu out of proportion. Only people with intimate contact with birds, in Asia the poor live with chickens in their houses, have gotten it. It is very difficult to spread through the air and it doesn't pass from human to human. The reason why it is so 'news worthy' is that it is a brand new strain no one in history has been exposed to and therefore no one has a natural immunity/resistance to, once you get it your immune system doesn't recognize it and put up a fight.

Don't worry about getting a flu shot. While you can't get the flu from a flu shot (a common myth), it won't protect you. The World Health Organization predicts the 3 most common strains every year and combines them in a single shot. Unfortunately these are only predictions, and there are over 3000 strains.

Viruses can swap genetic material and do so often. If bird flu gained the ability to be spread through the air and from person to person then we would have a disaster. Until then, I'd be more worried about the diseases your child will catch from other children. not a very big chance because we live in the U.S and it is in Japan! A minor risk. If you are in the US, there really is no risk at all. If a duck is visibly ill (not acting right), keep away from it.","For information purposes, the likelihood of a child getting bird flu from a bird is very low. The virus is primarily found in avian feces, and the risk increases with greater exposure to bird feces. The media has exaggerated the threat of bird flu, emphasizing that it is more common in regions where people live closely with birds, such as in certain parts of Asia. Bird flu is challenging to spread through the air and does not typically transmit from human to human. The novelty of new strains makes it newsworthy, as individuals lack natural immunity. Getting a flu shot is not a guarantee of protection, as the World Health Organization predicts common strains for the annual vaccine, but there are numerous strains. Viruses can exchange genetic material, and if bird flu gained the ability to spread through the air and between people, it could pose a significant threat.

What are some non-expensive ways to get rid of a cold?,"home made chicken soup Although it's a bit late now, the cheapest means of getting over a cold is a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a reduction of stress in your lifestyle. That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.

Here's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.

And, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again. Your body adapts to that viral strain. If you catch another cold right after you just get over your last one, it's a new cold and you came down with it because your immune system was already depressed from the most recent one. Chicken soup and Advil cold&Sinus...works wonderful and just het some rest The least expensive is just plain rest and taking care of yourself.

If you've been taking a lot of cold meds, they can mess with your system and cause you to not sleep well.  If it's the stuffiness that keeps you from sleeping try a vaporizer to help clear your sinuses. (A crock pot set on low makes a good vaporizer.  Just be careful where you place it.)

For stuffiness and headaches, you can make a mixture of a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a few drops of lavender oil then massage around your eyes. (Don’t get real close to your eye.)  Placing a warm moist cloth over your eyes after the massage will also help. Gargle with 3% H2O2 every hour until relieved.

what are the important effects of greeg tea?,"All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.

What does EGCG do?
Research has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.

It's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.

In short - it's good for you! as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic.

Unlike black and oolong teas, green tea is not fermented, preserving its active constituents, notably the polyphenolic antioxidant EGCG. Research suggests that EGCG in green tea contributes to cardiovascular health, boosts the immune system, and may inhibit the enzyme DHFR, a target for anti-cancer drugs. Despite numerous claims about green tea's health benefits, not all are scientifically substantiated due to ongoing research. In general, green tea is lauded for reducing bad cholesterol, offering an alkalizing effect on the body, in contrast to coffee's acidity, and providing a rich source of antioxidants.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"

Obviously it's not too bad at the moment because you've managed to cope with a big move, new city, and no friends around you. Doesn't sound like a person not in complete control of their life to me. Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?

So, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?

Overall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that. And if you think it does, well, perhaps you need to seek a different diagnosis. A professional one perhaps? I mean Joe Public can only help so much. for me iam at my happiest when i play with video games. but mainly long walks-up to 6 miles 3-4 times a day. plus i get involve with yahoo answers and feel better too. yes i understand ur situation, i would suggest u to join Yoga classes, i bet it will help you. i personaly would suggest The Art of living organisation. check out the link u will findout more. Don't worry, be happey!! I also move to another county years ago and I know what you are talking about. just do not stay at home, go out.... force yourself to go out... go and do some volunteer job where you can find freinds or take classes... just get out Try reading this book: The only way that I have ever been able to get out of depression is when I focus on Jesus. I pray and talk to him. It seems to be the only way becuase other wise there isn't a whole lot of hope in life. You need to find something within yourself that makes you happy.  Don't search for other people or places to make you happy -- it has to come from within.  Once you find something within yourself that makes you happy, the friends and other things start to fall into place.  Search for your own hope in a higher power such as God. Find a hobby or interest that makes you feel good and do it -- this may take some trial and error, and that is okay!  Good luck and I will pray for you. I work at a counseling center, so obviously I feel counseling is a great tool, I don't know where you are located but if you live in an area that is currently short on sun light, their are alot of people whos depression is physical due to lack of light. Sleep is also a huge impact on mood, if you are not rested you will not feel one hundred percent. If this continues to be an issue, I would encourage you to seek counseling to try to find the deap root of the problem.","To navigate depression, individuals employ diverse strategies. For one person, joy is found in activities like playing video games, taking long walks, and participating in online communities. Another suggests overcoming the challenges of moving to a new county by actively engaging in social activities, volunteering, or taking classes. A different approach involves finding solace in faith, with a focus on prayer and connection to Jesus as a source of hope. From a counseling perspective, seeking professional help is emphasized, especially for those affected by the physical aspects of depression in areas with limited sunlight.

Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure.

I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation.

what is inguinal herina.should it treated or not necessary.explain other type of herina?,"if you don't get it treated you will have very serious consequences that will eventually be fatal A hernia is a condition in which part of the intestine bulges through a weak area in muscles in the abdomen. An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called ""inguinal"" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.

Symptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.

The main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.) Its a protrusion of abdominal content frm inguinal canal. It must be treated to prevent further complications. Another hernia is femoral hernia where the content comes frm femoral canal. There are many other uncomman hernia also.","If left untreated, a hernia can lead to severe and potentially fatal consequences.

how long should it take to lose 100 lbs?,"Probably depends on how much that person weighs.  On the biggest loser show last year some people did it in like 12 weeks.

Weight loss seems to have lots of questions on here already, you might search other former answers. most doctor do not recommend losing more then 2 lbs a week.

So to lose that much weight in a healthy way should take about a year. The healthy way, approx. a year. That's if you want to keep it off. Four times longer than it took you to put it on. A safe way to think about it is, how long did it take you to gain 100lbs?  Then figure about twice as long to lose it.  That is being on the safe side and yes you can lose weight too quickly.  Your body and metabolism have to readjust to such drastic changes.  Losing or gaining  100 lbs is drastic. You probably can lose 2 lbs a week so about a year. However, you may be more successful going slower by just going for one pound a week. It takes longer but is less hard to reach your goal. Good luck. Ideally about 2 to 3 lb's per week, so about one year max. Approximately one year.","A prudent approach to weight loss is to consider the time it took to gain the weight. A general guideline is to estimate about twice as long to lose it safely. Rapid weight loss can be problematic as the body and metabolism need time to adjust to significant changes. Losing or gaining 100 lbs is considered drastic, and a safe rate of weight loss is often around 2 lbs per week. This suggests that losing 100 lbs could take about a year, and while aiming for one pound per week might take longer, it can be a less challenging and more sustainable approach.

Acne Treatment

|Self-Care at Home|

    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.

    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.

    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.

    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.

|Medical Treatment|

Many treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.

    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.

          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.

          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.

    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.

          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.

                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.

                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a ""bad sunburn"" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.

          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).

                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.

                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK I had acne for about 12 years, and it wouldn't go away inspite of the soaps, creams, lotions and antibiotics that I had used.  I got rid of acne after doing a treatment for candida.  I took herbal antifungals, lactobacillus acidophilus, and I was following an anti-candida diet. Acne takes years to get rid of. Many people right away use OTC medicine to cure it. Destorying the live bacteria on the face is a critical action. You should get rid of acne at the first sign. Chasing pimples all over your face becomes hectic but its the only way. Some people are allergic to bacteria killing medicine such as benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin. 
Try using these medicines:
1) Differin Topical Gel
2) Clearsal Brand Fighter.
3) Oxy
4) Proactiv (RISK: Increased Acne)
Rx:
1) Adoxa (Doxycyline Tablets)
2) Duac Topical Gel

Remember, allowing more oils and creams/lotions to your face means more blockage and heat to be stored. This causes the over size pimple. Make sure you have some sort of invigorating rubbing cream. St.Ives apricot scrub is the best.
If else fails, seek your Physician. An expert germ physician. At young acne years, doctors might perscribe you with bacteria killing pills. This is excellent. A topical gel working on the exterior side and an bacteria killing pill working interior.","Before using any medicines, It is suggested to consult a registered physician.

What is multiple sclerosis?,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.

The exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.

The inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.

Symptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).

Recurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.

Researchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.

People with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.

does drinking a lot of water kill your appetite? how often should i drink it?,"No. It doesn't.

Though no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help you estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.

Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:

Excessive thirst 
Fatigue 
Headache 
Dry mouth 
Little or no urination 
Muscle weakness 
Dizziness 
Lightheadedness 

Every day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?

This isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and ""out of habit."" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.

Replacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. 
Eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the ""8 x 8 rule"" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, ""drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,"" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. 
Dietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. I have to disagree with most of the people I guess. Drinking cold water does suppress appetite because it sits in your stomach longer and makes you feel fuller. Your stomach has to heat it up before your body can process it, so it can trick your stomach into curbing the urge for munchies. No, it doesn't kill your appetite. Depending on the climate in which you live you should drink 8 or more cups of water a day. you shud drink about half a gallon of water a day","It is suggested that determining the ideal daily fluid intake can vary among individuals, and while no single formula fits everyone, there are guidelines to estimate your needs. The ""8 x 8 rule"" suggests consuming eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, equivalent to about 1.9 liters. This rule emphasizes that all fluids contribute to the daily total. Climate can also influence water requirements, with a general recommendation of drinking 8 or more cups of water daily. Another perspective suggests consuming about half a gallon, emphasizing the importance of understanding your body's water usage and recognizing factors that can influence your hydration needs.",suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"

how does 1 get rid of chronic constipation?,"Try getting a good amount of fiber everyday.  Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor. Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.

Fortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.

Since dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.

A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.

Regular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.

If you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.

Laxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. 
Lemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. 
Orange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. 
Licorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. 
Grapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. 
Castor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. 
Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!
When it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies? are you a meat lover? if so, change your life style. be a vegetarian and fruitarian Eat lots of fruit and when you eat breads and cereals make sure that they are whole grain.

hope it helps. agree doctor is best place to start. Treatment depends on the cause so it would be best to see a doctor to find out what the exact cause is, so the proper treatment can be started. You have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:

Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy
    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.

    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:

The patient's age 
The ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. 
The general physical and mental health of the patient 
The patient's physical strength 
Vertigo Medication
    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. 

    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.

    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.

    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.

Vertigo Surgery
    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.

However, success depends on factors like age, ability to follow directions, and overall health. Medications may be prescribed, such as antibiotics for bacterial ear infections or drugs like meclizine for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, with potential side effects.

how do you get rid of the common cold?,"The common cold is primarily different varieties of viruses.  Viruses enter your body when your immune system has been weakened.

How do I cure hiccups?,"You are gonna get a lot of answers saying to hold your breath, but that only works sometimes and not with every person. Try holding an ice cube to your throat for about 20 to 30 seconds. Also try holding your nose while you take big gulps of water. What I have done for hiccups all my life is swallow saliva immediately after receiving the first hiccup and it goes away. I've done it forever and it works, try it next you get it. And don't over eat it sometimes causes hiccups. Hold your breath. Take a deep breath. Hold your breath under water for 10 minutes. Get a friend to help. Set a glass of water on a table with a straw in it and plug your ears and nose while drinking from the straw, I swear it works. The spoon full of sugar works too, but it's hard to swallow, you'll have to drink water anyway. Holding your breath doesn't really work. Burping does. There are two steps for a hiccup.. let's say you go hic (when you inhale) and then cup (when you exhale) Instead of exhaling the cup, burp it out. Hic, hold the air bubble in your throat and try to make it travel up, and burp it out. If you don't know how to make yourself burp (like myself), get yourself some coke or 7up or sprite, anything gassy to make you burp faster :o) eat one teaspoon of sugar, will provide instant relief! Eat a spoonful of sugar quickly. Your senses will overload with the response from the receptors that the sugar triggered off, and you won't hiccup anymore. focus on your middle name for 5-10 seconds then say it OUT LOUD. if that doesn't work, use brother/sisters middle name. 2 methods, both work, but one is a bit difficult
1. Bite down on the middle part of a straw or pen or pencil in your mouth (the straw is not in your mouth like you are using to drink with, you are biting on the middle so the ends are outside your mouth near your cheeks).  Then drink a half of a glass of water.

2.  Take a full glass of water and drink on the opposite side that you normally do (so your chin is pratically in the glass).  In order to do this you will have to bend your neck and head.  Drink about half the glass.

Good luck","  To cure hiccups, you can try various methods, such as holding an ice cube to your throat for about 20 to 30 seconds, holding your nose while taking big gulps of water, swallowing saliva immediately after the first hiccup, and avoiding overeating. Additionally, you can take a deep breath and hold it, submerge yourself underwater and hold your breath, or set a glass of water with a straw on a table, plug your ears and nose, and drink from the straw. Consuming a spoonful of sugar quickly or focusing on your middle name for 5-10 seconds and saying it out loud are alternative approaches. If these methods don't work, biting down on the middle part of a straw and then drinking half a glass of water or drinking a full glass of water with your chin practically in the glass, bending your neck and head, may provide relief by stimulating the vagus nerve or interrupting the hiccup reflex.",suggestion,"Defined as advice or recommendations to assist users in making informed medical decisions, solving problems, or improving health issues.","Advisory, Recommending"

HIV is a virus-the person's sex partner must have this virus in their body in order for this type of intercourse to spread HIV. If the sex partner does have the virus and this type of sex is performed-unprotected by use of condoms, this is a very efficient way of passing HIV from one person to another-especially if the person who is the insertor has HIV.

what is the best way to go through the grieving process of loosing a loved one?,"It does take time to grieve, and it often takes much longer than people think. This is especially true if you witnessed the violent death of your fiance. 

One of the ways that people grieve is to talk about the person they lost, the event if they witness it, and how their life is different since their loss. One of the problems is that people around you often feel that you should be over it by now, and they may not be as available to listen. So you might want to check out a community bereavement group that might allow you to talk with others over a period of a few months. For many people this helps them to process their loss.

For the record, I don't think you ever ""get over"" someone, but you are able to put the loss in perspective. I've heard people say that ""I haven't forgotten the person, but I can now think about them without crying!""

Your local hospice, hospital, mental health association or even a local funeral home may offer bereavement groups. Most of the time they are free of charge, as well.

Since you did witness the violent death of your fiance, you might also have some issues related to that trauma itself. If you have other symptoms of anxiety or depression you might want to talk this over with your doctor or a mental health professional. Everybody goes through it differently, and it can take time.  You just don't get over someone you love who dies--suddenly or otherwise.  Plus, you say he was killed in front of you--that suggests it may have been violent.  Dealing with that aspect alone is a major undertaking.

If you haven't already, you really need to talk about it with someone--even if it's just your boyfriend.  If he cares for you, he'll at least be a sympathetic ear.  You should consider a professional, too--maybe just a clergyman you know.  They're all trained in some basic counseling skills.  To move on from someone's death means accepting it, and you may need some help with that. Active, healthy grieving requires balance -- balancing the time you spend directly working on your grief with the time you spend coping with your day-to-day life; balancing the amount of time you spend with others with the time you spend alone; balancing your need for help from others with caring for yourself. Focusing too strongly on any single side of these pairings is getting off-track. 
Here are some things others have found useful in their healthy grieving.  

Grieving takes energy that will likely have to be temporarily withdrawn from the usual pursuits of your life. Treat yourself with the same care, tolerance, and affection you would extend to a valued friend in a similar situation.

Healthy grieving is an active process. It is NOT true that, ""You just need to give it time."" One way of understanding the work to be done is to think of grieving as a series of tasks we need to complete (not necessarily in sequence):

* To accept the finality of the loss; 
* To acknowledge and express the full range of feelings we experience as a result of the loss; 
* To adjust to a life in which the lost person, object, or experience is absent; 
* To 'say good-bye,' to ritualize our movement to a new peace with the loss.","In users expereince, one individual's perspective on grief suggests that the notion of ""getting over"" someone may not be entirely applicable; rather, the process involves placing the loss into perspective. Many express the sentiment that, with time, they can remember a departed loved one without succumbing to overwhelming sorrow. To facilitate this journey, local hospices, hospitals, mental health associations, or even funeral homes often offer bereavement groups. These groups, usually free of charge, serve as supportive communities where individuals can share their experiences and find solace in navigating the complexities of loss.",experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"

How can I best help someone who is bi-polar?,"Understand it as well as possible and then be supportive of treatments. This FAQ's might help you.

1. What is bipolar disorder? 

Bipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. 

2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? 

Bipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. 

3. What is rapid cycling? 

The term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. 

4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? 

Bipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. 

5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? 

Bipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. 

6. How is bipolar disorder treated? 

The cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. 

Psychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. 

7. What med I also know and am close to someone with said disease. If you are family and they aren't doing too well then you should take them to a mental health department of a hospital or something. If you're not family you should encourage the family to do the above. Research it. Many websites have how-to's for friends and families. Anyone with bipolar would be so pleased if their friends and/or family read more about it so they could be more easily understood.","Bipolar disorder is a prevalent psychiatric condition characterized by mood fluctuations, affecting 1% to 2% of the U.S. population. With a variant known as Bipolar II disorder impacting up to 3%, this illness manifests as manic episodes alternating with depression in Bipolar I and as recurrent depressive episodes with milder hypomanic states in Bipolar II. Rapid cycling, involving four or more mood episodes within a year, adds complexity to the disorder. Onset typically occurs in late teens or early 20s, and genetic factors contribute significantly.
