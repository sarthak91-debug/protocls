What's the best remedy for arthritic hands?,"Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  

There is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. 

When you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.

Results vary with patient.  I hope you find it useful. i have always wore a metal bracelette around mine and it always works for me I worked for two different Rheumatoligists in my career and found there is no ONE remedy.  Everyone reacts differently to a variety of medications which your rheumatologist needs to monitor.  Warmth is a comfort, warm climates, warm water, keeping hands and fingers as mobile as possible.  Don't let it go too far before seeking medical help.  Good Luck.","Individual reactions to medications vary, requiring monitoring by a rheumatologist. Managing rheumatoid arthritis involves seeking medical help early, as it is essentially an inflammation. Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be helpful, but oral administration may distribute the drug unevenly. Topical administration, using compounds like ketoprofen with a pain-reliever such as bupivacaine, can be effective.  Together , a combination of massages and anti-inflammatory therapy can potentially provide relief.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
what is the best way to cure dry skin?,"best stuff is jergens. I was once on hydrocortizone. if thats how you spell it. It didnt help, but jergens did. Use the one for extremely dry skin, the best they have. and use it every day. hydrocortizone is a medicine that doesnt cure you. it only keeps you on their medicine so that they can make more money off of you. Different things work for different people, but previous postings are good. Try a humidifier - I didn't used to like them, but there are many kinds to choose from now. Next, try the shorter, less frequent, less hot showers, using Dove creamy sensitive skin body wash, followed by Lubriderm sensitive skin lotion applied within 3 minutes of showering. Bag/udder balm also works for a lot of people... but even that may mean trying different brands. 

I had tried just about everything, and finally went to a dermatologist. Those recommendations (above) all helped.  Vaseline and other petroleum-based products feel great for a short time, but are ultimately drying. If you take hot showers you should either shorten the amount of timw you are in the shower or lower the temparature of your water. You just the amount of soap needed... using too much can dry your skin out, also use some kind of lotion or even that baby oil gel while your skin is still damp from the shower. For your feet use ""Udderly Smooth"" you cann find it in like Walmart and Walgreens and stuff... the bottle has cows print on it... that stuff works the best glycerine based soaps,shampoo or shower gel Run a humidifier in your home in the winter.  You wouldn't believe the difference this makes.  Winter air is dry, and it's even worse when you've got indoor heat running.  So keep the air in your home moist.

And then of course, a good moisturizer, like Neutrogena or Jergens helps a lot.  Use 3 times a day.   

But you really won't need as much active lotion care if you just keep the air less dry -- your skin will heal as you sleep in the healthier air in your home.  Sharper image has some good ionizing humidifiers.  I stopped needing lotion and chapstick altogether once I discovered this trick a few years ago. call your man, ask him, but tell him the truth Baby oil or vasileine vaseline or pure vitamin e oil whenever u get a chance smashed bananas and honey sounds gross but it works!!!!

why do i have backache?,"Well, there are any number of reasons you have a backache, and likewise, any number of remedies. The biggest reason is generally muscle strain.

What is the best way to treat dandruff?,"Dandruff can have a number of causes, from dry scalp to dermititis. It is now commonly believed that most dandruff is caused by a fungus like organism. The use of over-the-counter medicated shampoos works pretty well for most people. Neutrogena T/Gel and Nizoral are two shampoos that I have used that work very well.

Should Cannabis be legalized? Give reasons why yes or not.?,"i dont agree with the above quate, ""First comes Cannibus then comes Cocain"" sorry , but i hate to tell ya my first drug was ""COCAINE"" that led me to marijuana, and when i found that i no longer wanted cocaine, no lie, but on to the questions, Yes i do think it should be legalized reasons. 

IT HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE, LIKE TOBACCO AND ALCHOLE KILL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A YEAR, AND ITS LEAGAL BUT SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE, ISNT. THAT DONT MAKE SENSE IN MY HEAD... 

IT HAS ALOT OF MEDICAL USES, FROM EATING DISORDER PAITEINTS, CANCER PATIENTS MS, AND SOME MENTAL DISORDERS, MIGRAINS, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. 

IT DONT MAKE ANYONE VIOLENT OR STUPID LIKE THE COMMERCIALS YOU SEE ON TV. I HAVE NEVER FOUGHT ANYONE ON CANNIBUS, BUT ON ALCHOL I HAVE, IM TO MELLOW WHEN I HAVE SMOKED, 

THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF MARIJUANA USE ARE AWFULE TO. LIKE, IF YOU SMOKE YOU WILL BE A LOSER AND NEVER FIND A GOOD JOB. OH MI GOD, WHAT LIE, I KNOW PROMINANT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, THAT ARE IN MEDICAL FIELDS, AND THE LAW FIELD THAT SMOKE. AND THEY ARE BY FAR LOSERS. AND NOONE IS NONE THE WISER, ALSO THE COMMERCIALS THAT SAY ""IF YOU SMOKE MARIJUANA, YOU WILL (IN SO MANY WORDS) LET SOMETHING HAPPEN TO A LOVED ONE, UMMM I NEVER HAVE, 
JUST BECUASE I GOT HIGH. 

THERE IS A GOOD DOCUMENTRY CALLED GRASS. WOODY HAROLDSON ( I BELIEVE THAT IS WHO IT IS) NARRATES, AND IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE, ABOUT HOW IT ALL CAME TO BE ILLEGAL, 
AND ITS BEYOND ME WHY THE GOVERNMENT DONT LEGALIZE THINK OF ALL THE MONEY FROM TAXES THEY WOULD HAVE, WE MIGHT JUST SQUEEZE OUT OF THIS DEBT. THAT OUR ""WONDERFUL""(NOTE SARCASIM) PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN US IN TO.... 

ANY WAY HELL YEAH LEGALIZE..!!!! there is not enough reasons for it to be kept illegal. more so, it has a lot of medicinal benefits sure-legalization equals taxation. then we should tackle prostitution Even though I wouldn't smoke it even if it were legalized (I'm asthmatic) I wouldn't oppose its legalization as long as its use is restricted to adults who are not driving or operating dangerous machinery. I believe that marijuana usage can dangerously impair someone who is driving and should have the same restrictions that we currently have for alcoholic beverages.
   By the way, I would never be in favor of legalizing drugs like cocaine, heroine, crystal methamphetamine or ecstasy unless they could be proven to have a medical benefit and be used under the supervision of physicians. No , because mostly who begins with Cannabis ; finish with Cocain . The problem lies within the governing of it. How does uncle Sam get a piece of the action?

One individual shares a personal experience, expressing support for legalization due to marijuana's non-lethal nature, medical benefits, and the misconception of its negative effects. They highlight the contradiction of legalizing substances like tobacco and alcohol, which cause thousands of deaths, while marijuana, with its purported medical uses, remains illegal. Another perspective emphasizes the lack of sufficient reasons to keep marijuana illegal, emphasizing its medicinal benefits. A third opinion acknowledges the potential dangers of impaired driving but supports legalization with restrictions for adult use, drawing a distinction between marijuana and more harmful drugs like cocaine, heroin, crystal methamphetamine, or ecstasy. This person suggests considering the medical benefits of these substances under proper supervision if proven effective. Overall, the opinions range from supporting legalization for various reasons to advocating restrictions for responsible adult use.",experience,"Defined as individual experiences, anecdotes, or firsthand insights related to health, medical treatments, medication usage, and coping strategies","Personal, Narrative"
Should Cannabis be legalized? Give reasons why yes or not.?,"i dont agree with the above quate, ""First comes Cannibus then comes Cocain"" sorry , but i hate to tell ya my first drug was ""COCAINE"" that led me to marijuana, and when i found that i no longer wanted cocaine, no lie, but on to the questions, Yes i do think it should be legalized reasons. 

IT HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE, LIKE TOBACCO AND ALCHOLE KILL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A YEAR, AND ITS LEAGAL BUT SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE, ISNT. THAT DONT MAKE SENSE IN MY HEAD... 

IT HAS ALOT OF MEDICAL USES, FROM EATING DISORDER PAITEINTS, CANCER PATIENTS MS, AND SOME MENTAL DISORDERS, MIGRAINS, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. 

IT DONT MAKE ANYONE VIOLENT OR STUPID LIKE THE COMMERCIALS YOU SEE ON TV. I HAVE NEVER FOUGHT ANYONE ON CANNIBUS, BUT ON ALCHOL I HAVE, IM TO MELLOW WHEN I HAVE SMOKED, 

THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF MARIJUANA USE ARE AWFULE TO. LIKE, IF YOU SMOKE YOU WILL BE A LOSER AND NEVER FIND A GOOD JOB. OH MI GOD, WHAT LIE, I KNOW PROMINANT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, THAT ARE IN MEDICAL FIELDS, AND THE LAW FIELD THAT SMOKE. AND THEY ARE BY FAR LOSERS. AND NOONE IS NONE THE WISER, ALSO THE COMMERCIALS THAT SAY ""IF YOU SMOKE MARIJUANA, YOU WILL (IN SO MANY WORDS) LET SOMETHING HAPPEN TO A LOVED ONE, UMMM I NEVER HAVE, 
JUST BECUASE I GOT HIGH. 

THERE IS A GOOD DOCUMENTRY CALLED GRASS. WOODY HAROLDSON ( I BELIEVE THAT IS WHO IT IS) NARRATES, AND IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE, ABOUT HOW IT ALL CAME TO BE ILLEGAL, 
AND ITS BEYOND ME WHY THE GOVERNMENT DONT LEGALIZE THINK OF ALL THE MONEY FROM TAXES THEY WOULD HAVE, WE MIGHT JUST SQUEEZE OUT OF THIS DEBT. THAT OUR ""WONDERFUL""(NOTE SARCASIM) PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN US IN TO.... 

ANY WAY HELL YEAH LEGALIZE..!!!! there is not enough reasons for it to be kept illegal. more so, it has a lot of medicinal benefits sure-legalization equals taxation. then we should tackle prostitution Even though I wouldn't smoke it even if it were legalized (I'm asthmatic) I wouldn't oppose its legalization as long as its use is restricted to adults who are not driving or operating dangerous machinery. I believe that marijuana usage can dangerously impair someone who is driving and should have the same restrictions that we currently have for alcoholic beverages.
   By the way, I would never be in favor of legalizing drugs like cocaine, heroine, crystal methamphetamine or ecstasy unless they could be proven to have a medical benefit and be used under the supervision of physicians. No , because mostly who begins with Cannabis ; finish with Cocain . The problem lies within the governing of it. How does uncle Sam get a piece of the action? If it were to be legalized, people would grow it at home or in hiding like they do now. Who would buy it for a high taxed price when they can get it cheaper on the street? Absolutely!!!

This includes wreckless driving or stealing munchies from the mini-mart.

Despite the fact that no one has ever died from using cannabis and it has numerous medicinal benefits, this perspective emphasizes the importance of holding individuals accountable for their actions, even under the influence of cannabis. The argument acknowledges that while cannabis may not directly cause dangerous behaviors like reckless driving or theft, individuals should still be responsible for their actions and cannot blame cannabis for their choices.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"

Are teeth capable of replacing worn enamel?,"No. Our teeth (I'm referring to humans) are brachydont; that is, they only grow for a limited period and afterwards the roots of the tooth become closed. This means that there will be no new materials added, and they will become more and more worn. However, enamel is the hardest tissue in our entire bodies, so normally it doesn't wear off completely during a lifetime.
Other mammals have ever-growing teeth; in that case both enamel and dentine are replaced constantly.
_________________
Streamcat, I hope you're joking. And I thought the question referred to a natural process. Of course dentists can replace enamel with synthetic materials.
-----------------
Can certain animals grow new enamel? Yes, but not in the sense of ""repairing"" their teeth. It's more simple than that: the distal part of the tooth (the functional end) is continually being worn, and the new tissues arise from the basal parts. Those are hypsodont teeth (as rodent incisors and the molars of many herbivores). If you get the chance to examine a rodent skull, you'll see that their incisors don't really have roots, they look like long curved cylinders with an open base. How do those animals do that? If we are smarter than animals should'nt we be able to figure out how to do that? The apical foramen may be small, but its not closed. Fillings are just a patch, I would'nt consider them to replace enamel. Let's say there is carious lesion on the surface of a tooth.  If it is deep into the dentin, then there's no going back.  However, if the lesion is just on the surface of the enamel, it can be restored. No, but human teeth can grow some new dentin in a spot where decay has reached the pulp. Can certain animals grow new enamel?","No, human teeth cannot grow new enamel. Our teeth are brachydont, meaning they only grow for a limited period, and the roots eventually close. The enamel on human teeth does not regenerate or grow back. Once the enamel is worn or damaged, it cannot be naturally replaced. Dentists can use synthetic materials for enamel replacement or restore teeth with fillings, but this is not a natural growth process.

I have no insurance and need help paying for my insulin. Are there any programs that can help me?,"It all depends on where you live.
You should have added which state you live in?
If your in Indiana. You might try getting on Indiana Medicaid. Contact the insulin manufacturer directly. My wife's aunt lost her insurance and got free insulin from them. There are various resources that you can probably consult to get assistance in paying for your diabetic supplies / insulin. A good starting point would be your local department of health location or local social services office. Both locations should be able to refer you to the appropriate program or service to meet your needs. Your local health department (depending on where you live) may also have what is known as a ""pharmacy access"" or ""pharmacy assistance"" program. These programs are in place to assist individuals of limited means access the necessary medications and pharmaceutical supplies to treat their medical conditions. 
There are probably several other resources you might consider contacting. Many Red Cross chapters offer such assistance, as well as private medical practices and even church groups. Don't be afraid to ask your primary care doctor or diabetic specialist for assistance in securing resources for this problem. Also, consider doing an internet search and check out some of the major pharmaceutical companies (Bayer, Abbott, etc.) Maybe they offer assistance as well. I am sure help is out there for you.

Bush mmmm...water and lettuce!! A diet without carbohydrates.  A no carb diet is probably a bad idea, but low-carb diets have been very popular in recent years.

As with any diet, it works best if you eat sensible portions and exercise. Low carb diets are based on the premise that a diet very low in carbohydrate leads to a reduction in the body's insulin production, resulting in fat and protein (muscle) stores being used as its main energy source Foolishness. Carbs are not necesarily bad for you unless you get the type that is. You must look up waht not eat or ask your doctor, or a nutritionist. Low carb diet” (also called “reduced carbohydrate” or “controlled carbohydrate”) is a broad term, encompassing many popular diet books (examples: Atkins, South Beach, Zone, Protein Power, Sugar Busters, Carbohydrate Addicts Diet) as well as eating plans that don’t follow a rigid format, but advise limiting the consumption of foods with a lot of carbohydrate. Some diets limit the amount of overall carbohydrate, while others focus on certain types of foods, generally ones high in starch and sugars, such as the “No White Foods” approach. Still others focus on how glycemic the diet is.

It’s important not to equate “low carb” with the very low carb phase of some popular diets. These phases are usually meant to be quite short, with more carbohydrate phased in after that. Other diets begin at a higher level of carbohydrate, but still less than the USDA Food Pyramid suggests. Any diet whose primary focus is the reduction of carbohydrate in any way is what is meant by “low carb” on this site. In terms of percentages, since the usual “mainstream” recommendation is a diet with 50-65% calories from carbohydrate, I consider a diet with 40% or less energy from carbs a “low-carb diet”, though most of them don’t measure it in this way. The natives in Alaska, I think their called the Inuit, live off of only meat which has no carbs. Though this diet doesn't seem to fair well with most others accustomed to a eurasian diet. And you can get scurvy if you cook the meat, strangley enough. The meat tends to lose their vitamins when cooked.","For information purposes, a diet without carbohydrates, commonly known as a no-carb diet, is explored in the text. While acknowledging the popularity of low-carb diets in recent years, it cautions against the potential pitfalls of completely eliminating carbohydrates. The importance of maintaining sensible portions and incorporating exercise into any diet is highlighted. Carbohydrates are defined as sugars or foods that convert into sugar in the body, with examples ranging from pasta and potatoes to cookies and bread. The text discusses the Atkins diet, a notable no-carb approach, recognizing its effectiveness in initial weight loss but noting the challenges of long-term adherence. It further delves into the broader category of low-carb diets, encompassing various popular plans and approaches, and emphasizes the distinction between short-term very low carb phases and more sustainable reduced carbohydrate diets.

how do you get rid of the common cold?,"The common cold is primarily different varieties of viruses.  Viruses enter your body when your immune system has been weakened.  This could be due to a number of factors.  The most common is lack of rest.  If you do not receive the proper amount of sleep every night, your immune system is weakened.  

The best way (I have found) get rid of a cold is to get LOTS of rest, drink lots of oj (nonconcentrated), and drinking PLENTY of water.  Water helps to flush out all impurities in your body.  This has always helped me to recover quickly.

Another way to boost your immune system is to a daily mulit-vitman.  Make sure that it has B-12 in it as well.  B-12 is execellent for boosting and maintaining a healthy immune system. Zicam.  It really works.  
It is a zinc compound.
I'm on my first cold of the season, I'm counting on Zicam to shorten it.
I've avoided them so far using this.
I think that the only reason this one got me is because I started on Zicam late as this cold manifested overnight. flush it out
drink as much water and juices with vitamic c as possible. A few years ago, a new natural product hit the market. It's called AIRBORNE and was developed by a second-grade teacher. It is amazing. It is best to take it when you first notice symptoms.  I have used it several times with excellent results. I have also given it to my family members and they too have had their ""cold time"" greatly reduced.

I also take 1000 mg C in the morning and another dose 12 hours later.

http://www.airbornehealth.com/main.html I go nuts with EmergenC (whatever your body doesn't need, it will flush out).  Also, since there's little else that can be done, I just pamper myself with yummy, tasty food, baths, movie rentals, etc...  If you absolutely have to stay home from work, treat it like a mini-vacation.  I seriously believe that eliminating stress and raising your happiness levels makes the cold go away faster. Let it be__It is only the miracle of the body eliminating excess. The worst you can do is to treat the symptom with medication as they will only stop the cleansing process leaving not only the excess but also the residual drug residue.

Take some decongestant and soothers.

watch TV.
Enjoy The common cold is caused by viruses. There's very little we can do against that. You just have to wait for the battle between your immune system and the virus to finish. Anything you can do to help your immune system would help though, like be careful not to get a second infection or catch anything bacterial, etc. Plenty of fluids and plenty of rest.

A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]

The avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3. Bird Flu 
Hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the ""bird flu."" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.

The only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia.","For information purposes, avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is caused by influenza viruses hosted by birds but capable of infecting various mammal species. Originating in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s, it has become a global concern. The H5N1-type, identified in 1997, is a potential source of a future influenza pandemic and has caused numerous human infections in Asia, resulting in significant fatalities. Avian influenza subtypes in humans include H1N1 (Spanish flu), H2N2 (Asian Flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu), H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, and H7N3. The virus, particularly strain H5N1, has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia, impacting poultry in various countries. While the disease is highly contagious among birds, transmission to humans occurs through close contact or exposure to infected bird feces, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Eradication involves culling infected flocks, and millions of poultry have been culled to contain the virus. There is concern that the virus could potentially combine with a human influenza virus, leading to a serious epidemic.

Is there a life insurance for people with cancer.?,"Depends on the type of cancer and how far along the treatments are.  The best bet is to contact a local life agent and give them all the information. Don't try to hide anything because it could result in a denial of payout down the road.  A local agent can talk with their underwriter to determine if they can write the policy and at what health class. Buy term life insurance.  Its relatively cheap, like 25 buxx a month depending on age.  Go and get about 4 or 5 different policies if you think this person is going to die.  Because they pay really low.  Like 20 grand if the person dies.  But, if they die in less then 2 years,  I think its only like 2000 plus how much you paid per month for every month that you paid.  So, if you paid 25 a month for 6 months, and the person dies, they give you only 2000 plus 150.  But if you can buy 4 or 5 of these, you can find 10 grand to bury this person.  These are the only insurance companies that will sell to you because they dont have to pay back anything to you.  If you cancel with no death, they owe you nothing.","The advice given suggests buying term life insurance, specifically multiple policies, if the person is expected to die. The recommendation is to obtain about 4 or 5 different policies, as they pay relatively low amounts (e.g., 20 grand if the person dies). If the person dies within two years, the payout is calculated based on the premiums paid. The suggestion is to purchase multiple policies to accumulate enough funds for burial expenses. The recommendation also emphasizes honesty with the life insurance agent to avoid denial of payout later.

what is aortic valve replacement?,"it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow. The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.

There are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.

There is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.

Current cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices. The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed.","For information purposes, the aortic valve serves as the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta, facilitating the flow of fresh oxygenated blood throughout the body. Diseases such as aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency may necessitate the replacement of this valve. There are two primary types of aortic valve replacements: mechanical valves, which have a well-established safety record but require lifelong blood thinners, and biologic/tissue valves, which eliminate the need for blood thinners but may have lower durability. The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction. Aortic bypass surgery is often performed to address a malfunctioning aortic valve, acknowledging the complexity of the procedure due to the aorta's significance as the body's largest blood vessel.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
how can you releive sciatic pain?,"Manual treatments for sciatica, including physical therapy and specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and manual manipulation (e.g. osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation) to help relieve the pressure on the nerve root, which is the cause of the pain.

what are the important effects of greeg tea?,"All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.

What does EGCG do?
Research has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.

It's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.

In short - it's good for you! as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic. 
just about anything green/fruits/vegetables  helps us this way. Green tea also has a lot of antioxidants","For information purposes, all types of tea, be it black, green, or oolong, originate from the same plant, with variations arising from post-harvest processing. Unlike black and oolong teas, green tea is not fermented, preserving its active constituents, notably the polyphenolic antioxidant EGCG. Research suggests that EGCG in green tea contributes to cardiovascular health, boosts the immune system, and may inhibit the enzyme DHFR, a target for anti-cancer drugs. Despite numerous claims about green tea's health benefits, not all are scientifically substantiated due to ongoing research. In general, green tea is lauded for reducing bad cholesterol, offering an alkalizing effect on the body, in contrast to coffee's acidity, and providing a rich source of antioxidants.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"

is ther a way of removing gall stones without surgery?,"There is often some confusion on the difference between gallstones and kidney stones.  Kidney stones form in urine in the kidneys (redundant, I know, but hang in there).  They are most commonly calcium oxalate (but calcium doesn't cause the stones!).  In order for them to be passed without surgery, they have to go through the ureters to the urine bladder, and then through the urethra to exit the body.

Gallstones are formed in the gall bladder which stores bile created by the liver.  They are most commonly formed of cholesterol.  The gall bladder pumps bile into the top of the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and fat soluble vitamins.  And here's the big difference.  If a gallstone actually makes it out of the gallbladder, it will enter the small intestines and leave the body in feces.  

The bile duct, btw, is normally about 4mm but may go up to 7mm if there are lodged stones.  

Now consider what someone who is claiming that their solution will allow gallstones to pass the body (with pictures!) is supposedly doing to find these gallstones.

(And because I can't resist a good line)  If you pee it out, it's a kidney stone, if you poop it out it's a gallstone.


Now, having said all of that, I see that the Mayo clinic does have a sound wave treatment for gallstones, but they indicate that it is appropriate for only a small number of cases.  And that the gallstones will come back on you unless you take a special medicine for the rest of your life.

How can you keep someone from snoring?,"You can help prevent snoring by:
Losing weight (if necessary). 
Going to bed at the same time every night and getting plenty of sleep. 
Sleeping on your side, not on your back. Try sewing a pocket in the middle of the back of your pajama top, putting a tennis ball into the pocket, and stitching it closed. This will help keep you from sleeping on your back. 
Avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives before bed. 
Quitting smoking. 
Raising the head of your bed 4 in. (10 cm) to 6 in. (15 cm) by putting bricks under the legs of the bed (using pillows to raise your head and upper body will not work). 
Promptly treating breathing problems, such as a stuffy nose caused by a cold or allergies. 
Using nasal strips, which widen the nostrils and improve airflow. The following are questions most often asked of doctors about snoring and snoring treatment. Easy, sleep on your belly They sell these little tape things that fit over your nose.  They really work and are not uncomfortable.

www.breatheright.com/index.asp Tickle their mustache!

Actually, those little breathing strips really do work. I had a BAD problem with snoring and tried everything.

A mouthpiece -- no go
Nasal Strips -- not a chance
Sprays -- hah don't even try that snake oil

What did work was something that my wife suggested and I have yet to snore since.

Before going to bed, put a piece of candy or cough drop between your cheek and gum in the back of your mouth (sugarless so not to rot your teeth)

The muscles in the face holding the candy in place will not allow you to snore. Try it when you are awake and you will see you cannot make a snoring sound.

The only downside is once or twice a month I do have it fall out and when it lands in the wrong place (on the pillow and then roll over on it having it stuck to my cheek) it can be a little messy but it does work. I used to snore in the winter because the air was so dry at night.  My husband got me a humidifier which we keep in our room every night, and I haven't snored since.  

You might also try having him sleep on his side or stomach.  You are much more likely to snore when lying on your back. lol well what i did when i was married lmao too funny every time he would snore i would jab him in the ribs then after 2 weeks of learning better he stopped lol it really worked for 7 years no snoring Yea you can keep him in cabinet, 
but u cnt stop him from snoring! The most effective way is to get them to lose a little weight, which stops fat pressing on the throat. Stopping smoking also helps, as does sleeping on one's side.

Wikipedia also recommends throat exercises, singing and practicing yoga.","To aid in smoking cessation, effective methods include using small breathing strips that adhere to the nose, helping improve airflow. Additionally, weight loss is highlighted as a potent strategy, alleviating pressure on the throat caused by excess fat. Quitting smoking itself is emphasized as beneficial, along with adopting the habit of sleeping on one's side.

Actually, those little breathing strips really do work. I had a BAD problem with snoring and tried everything.

A mouthpiece -- no go
Nasal Strips -- not a chance
Sprays -- hah don't even try that snake oil

What did work was something that my wife suggested and I have yet to snore since.

Before going to bed, put a piece of candy or cough drop between your cheek and gum in the back of your mouth (sugarless so not to rot your teeth)

The muscles in the face holding the candy in place will not allow you to snore. Try it when you are awake and you will see you cannot make a snoring sound.

The only downside is once or twice a month I do have it fall out and when it lands in the wrong place (on the pillow and then roll over on it having it stuck to my cheek) it can be a little messy but it does work. I used to snore in the winter because the air was so dry at night.  My husband got me a humidifier which we keep in our room every night, and I haven't snored since.  

You might also try having him sleep on his side or stomach.  You are much more likely to snore when lying on your back. lol well what i did when i was married lmao too funny every time he would snore i would jab him in the ribs then after 2 weeks of learning better he stopped lol it really worked for 7 years no snoring Yea you can keep him in cabinet,

GET WELL SOON. It sounds like allergies to me. If you are not restricted I would take a benadryl and see a low cost clinic. It could get worse. if what you have is allergies, you can take an antihistamine to relieve the symptoms, and then get plenty of rest. if it's bad sinusitis, get an OTC drug for it and drink lots of fluids and vitamin c in the form of fruits... and get bed rest.

if it's something else, go to your doctor.","If you're feeling unwell, it's important to prioritize rest and stay hydrated with clean water.

what is a cure for TINNITUS?,"Home Treatment

The following tips may help you reduce symptoms of tinnitus.

-Cut back on or eliminate alcohol and beverages containing caffeine.

-Stop smoking and stop using smokeless tobacco products. Nicotine use makes tinnitus worse by reducing blood flow to the structures of the ear.

-Limit your use of aspirin, products containing aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen.

-Exercise regularly. Exercise improves blood flow to the structures of the ear. However, avoid extended periods of exercise, such as bicycle riding, that keep your neck in a hyperextended position. For more information, see the topic Fitness. 

While waiting to see whether tinnitus goes away, or if your health professional has advised you that your tinnitus will be present for a long time, try these methods to cope with the constant noise:

-Limit or avoid exposure to the noises you suspect are causing your tinnitus. If you cannot avoid loud noises, wear protective earplugs or earmuffs.

-Try to ignore the sound by directing your attention to other things.

-Practice relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation, or yoga. Stress and fatigue seem to make tinnitus worse.

-Quiet rooms can cause tinnitus to seem more distracting. Background noise may reduce the amount of noise you hear. Play music or white noise when you are trying to fall asleep or anytime you find yourself in a quiet place. You may consider buying a machine that makes soothing sounds, such as ocean waves.

-Try the herbal supplement ginkgo biloba. Some studies suggest that it may help relieve tinnitus, but other studies do not show a benefit. Further studies are needed to determine the best dosage. That first answer had a lot of hints and yet not the one that I know works - and that is to drink more water.  Dehydration is the basic cause of tinnitus.  Start drinking the 8 glasses (that's about 2 quarts a day).  Coffee doesn't count, it's a diuretic and depletes your system of water.

Without enough water, you can't wash away the toxins from your body.  For me, it's the easy answer that works.","Avoid or reduce alcohol, caffeine, and smoking, as they worsen tinnitus. Limit aspirin and NSAIDs; exercise regularly to improve blood flow to the ear. Avoid prolonged neck positions during exercise. Use ear protection in noisy environments; distract attention away from the noise. Practice relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga to manage stress, which can worsen tinnitus.

2.  Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.  Soda or alcohol before sleep is the WORST!

3.  Limit intake of:  Alcohol, Caffience, Carbonated beverages, spicy foods, acidic foods, aspirin (or advil, motrin).

Be good keeping 1 & 2 and you can cheat on 3 -- at least, that's worked for me.

Good luck! i drink milk and my heartburn goes away. i have never taken medicine for heartburn when i get it. If your heartburn is persistant and regular, I'd suggest seeing a Dr. You may suffer from acid reflux and there are many drugs on the market for it. I've found that prevacid is the ONLY one that works for me, but your Dr. may want you to try some of the least expensive ones first. On the other hand, if it is infrequent, it may just be caused by some foods that you eat. I'd try to compare times when I had it with the foods I was eating and if you can narrow it down, simply avoid those foods or be sure to take something BEFORE you eat these foods, to ward it off. Hope this is helpful.","For immediate relief from heartburn, the recommendation is to use Maalox, with a caution against Pepto Bismol due to potential long-term stomach irritation, as advised by a gastroenterologist. For extended use, Priolosec is suggested. Additionally, It is suggested to refrain from eating at least three hours before bedtime, as a reclining position with a full stomach can irritate the esophagus, with specific emphasis on avoiding soda or alcohol before sleep. The individual recommends limiting the intake of alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages, spicy and acidic foods, as well as aspirin or similar medications. If heartburn persists, the suggestion is to consult a doctor, as it could indicate acid reflux.

how do u get rid of lice?,"Go to your local pharmacy or drugstore.  You can purchase a product called ""RID"". Its a shampoo that kills headlice.  Once you've shampooed, you'll take the small comb, that comes with the shampoo to comb the hair to remove dead lice or possible eggs that may be attatched.  Very important to stip bed of sheets and pillow cases and wash in hot water as soon as possible, too.   Good luck!  (Rid is sold over the counter, btw..so don't be embarrassed.) Rid can sometimes cause damage to the blood and brain cells on the head if there are scratches or open cuts when applied.  Also, not all lice is killed by using Rid.  Try putting either vaseline or olive oil in the hair and on the head.  Wrap with saran wrap for about an hour.  Rinse out.  It kills the lice and the eggs by suffocation. soak ure hair in mayo, like shampoo, and cover it in tin foil GO TO WAL MART I THINK THE THING IS CALLED RID Don't use the stuff you buy in stores, that is a pesticide and it doesn't really work.  This is how I've dealt with headlice.  

The first thing you have to do is apply a thick coating of either Vaseline or mineral oil to the hair.  Get a plastic shower cap and put it on. Leave the stuff in the hair over the weekend.

what is an aflatoxin?,"PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI


Reddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as ""Turkey 'X' Disease"" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.

Natural occurrence:

Food products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. 

Physical and chemical properties:

Aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide. if you live in the united states, who cares?  THis is a disese of 3rd world countries where wheat and other such products spoil and have a fungus in them which produces toxins which promote the formation of liver cancer.

HOW DO U GET RID OF ACNE?,"DISCLAIMER: Before using any medicines, you should consult a registered physiscian. This is only for information.

Acne Treatment

|Self-Care at Home|

    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.

    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.

    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.

    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.

|Medical Treatment|

Many treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.

    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.

          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.

Why are people (me) plagued with dandruff? How the heck do I get rid of it? I have tried almost EVERYTHING!!?,"Dandruff is thought to be caused by a form of a skin condition called eczema, which causes increased shedding of normal scalp skin cells. Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse.
Here are some tips.
Learn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. 
Shampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff.

Smooth muscles are controlled by the autonomic nervous system and can be either generally inactive, responding to neural stimulation or hormones, or rhythmic in nature. Cardiac muscles, found in the heart, exhibit rhythmic activity influenced by neural signals and hormones. Skeletal muscles, responsible for movement, are attached to bones through tendons and can be categorized based on factors such as twitch speed, voluntary or involuntary control, and coloration. Together, these three types of muscles play crucial roles in various physiological functions, encompassing involuntary processes like digestion, the rhythmic pumping of blood in the heart, and voluntary movements required for daily activities.",information,"Defined as knowledge about diseases, disorders, and health-related facts, providing insights into symptoms and diagnosis.","Informative, Educational"
